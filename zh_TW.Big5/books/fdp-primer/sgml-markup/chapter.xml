  <title>SGML Markup</title>

  <para>This chapter describes the two markup languages you will encounter
    when you contribute to the FreeBSD documentation project.  Each section
    describes the markup language, and details the markup that you are likely
    to want to use, or that is already in use.</para>

  <para>These markup languages contain a large number of elements, and it can
    be confusing sometimes to know which element to use for a particular
    situation.  This section goes through the elements you are most likely to
    need, and gives examples of how you would use them.</para>

  <para>This is <emphasis>not</emphasis> an exhaustive list of elements, since
    that would just reiterate the documentation for each language.  The aim of
    this section is to list those elements more likely to be useful to you.
    If you have a question about how best to markup a particular piece of
    content, please post it to the &a.doc;.</para>

  <note>
    <title>Inline vs. block</title>

    <para>In the remainder of this document, when describing elements,
      <emphasis>inline</emphasis> means that the element can occur within a
      block element, and does not cause a line break.  A
      <emphasis>block</emphasis> element, by comparison, will cause a line
      break (and other processing) when it is encountered.</para>
  </note>

  <sect1 xml:id="sgml-markup-html">
    <title>HTML</title>

    <para>HTML, the HyperText Markup Language, is the markup language of
      choice on the World Wide Web.  More information can be found at
      &lt;URL:<uri xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</uri>&gt;.</para>

    <para>HTML is used to markup pages on the FreeBSD web site.  It should not
      (generally) be used to mark up other documentation,
      since DocBook offers a
      far richer set of elements to choose from.  Consequently, you will
      normally only encounter HTML pages if you are writing for the web
      site.</para>

    <para>HTML has gone through a number of versions, 1, 2, 3.0, 3.2, and the
      latest, 4.0 (available in both <emphasis>strict</emphasis> and
      <emphasis>loose</emphasis> variants).</para>

    <para>The HTML DTDs are available from the ports collection in the
      <package>textproc/html</package> port.  They are automatically
      installed as part of the <package>textproc/docproj</package>
      port.</para>

    <sect2>
      <title>Formal Public Identifier (FPI)</title>

      <para>There are a number of HTML FPIs, depending upon the version (also
	known as the level) of HTML that you want to declare your document to
	be compliant with.</para>

      <para>The majority of HTML documents on the FreeBSD web site comply with
	the loose version of HTML 4.0.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2>
      <title>Sectional elements</title>

      <para>An HTML document is normally split into two sections.  The first
	section, called the <emphasis>head</emphasis>, contains
	meta-information about the document, such as its title, the name of
	the author, the parent document, and so on.  The second section, the
	<emphasis>body</emphasis>, contains the content that will be displayed
	to the user.</para>

      <para>These sections are indicated with <tag>head</tag> and
	<tag>body</tag> elements respectively.  These elements are
	contained within the top-level <tag>html</tag> element.</para>

      <example>
	<title>Normal HTML document structure</title>

	<programlisting>&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
	  &lt;title&gt;<replaceable>The document's title</replaceable>&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;

    &hellip;

  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</programlisting>
      </example>
    </sect2>

      <title>Block elements</title>

      <sect3>
	<title>Headings</title>

	<para>HTML allows you to denote headings in your document, at up to
	  six different levels.</para>

	<para>The largest and most prominent heading is <tag>h1</tag>,
	  then <tag>h2</tag>, continuing down to
	  <tag>h6</tag>.</para>

	<para>The element's content is the text of the heading.</para>

	<example>
	  <title><tag>h1</tag>, <tag>h2</tag>, etc.</title>

	  <para>Use:</para>

	  <programlisting>&lt;h1&gt;First section&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;!&hyphen;- Document introduction goes here -&hyphen;&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This is the heading for the first section&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;!&hyphen;- Content for the first section goes here -&hyphen;&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;This is the heading for the first sub-section&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;!&hyphen;- Content for the first sub-section goes here -&hyphen;&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;This is the heading for the second section&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;!&hyphen;- Content for the second section goes here -&hyphen;&gt;</programlisting>
	</example>

	<para>Generally, an HTML page should have one first level heading
	  (<tag>h1</tag>).  This can contain many second level
	  headings (<tag>h2</tag>), which can in turn contain many
	  third level headings.  Each
	  <tag>h<replaceable>n</replaceable></tag> element should have
	  the same element, but one further up the hierarchy, preceding it.
	  Leaving gaps in the numbering is to be avoided.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Bad ordering of
	    <tag>h<replaceable>n</replaceable></tag> elements</title>

	  <para>Use:</para>

	  <programlisting>&lt;h1&gt;First section&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;!&hyphen;- Document introduction -&hyphen;&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Sub-section&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;!&hyphen;- This is bad, &lt;h2&gt; has been left out -&hyphen;&gt;</programlisting>
	</example>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Paragraphs</title>

	<para>HTML supports a single paragraph element,
	  <tag>p</tag>.</para>

	<example>
	  <title><tag>p</tag></title>

	  <para>Use:</para>

	  <programlisting><![CDATA[<p>This is a paragraph.  It can contain just about any
  other element.</p>]]></programlisting>
	</example>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Block quotations</title>

	<para>A block quotation is an extended quotation from another document
	  that should not appear within the current paragraph.</para>

	<example>
	  <title><tag>blockquote</tag></title>

	  <para>Use:</para>

	  <programlisting><![CDATA[<p>A small excerpt from the US Constitution:</p>

<blockquote>We the People of the United States, in Order to form
  a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic
  Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general
  Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our
  Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the
  United States of America.</blockquote>]]></programlisting>
	</example>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Lists</title>

	<para>You can present the user with three types of lists, ordered,
	  unordered, and definition.</para>

	<para>Typically, each entry in an ordered list will be numbered, while
	  each entry in an unordered list will be preceded by a bullet point.
	  Definition lists are composed of two sections for each entry.  The
	  first section is the term being defined, and the second section is
	  the definition of the term.</para>

	<para>Ordered lists are indicated by the <tag>ol</tag>
	  element, unordered lists by the <tag>ul</tag> element, and
	  definition lists by the <tag>dl</tag> element.</para>

	<para>Ordered and unordered lists contain listitems, indicated by the
	  <tag>li</tag> element.  A listitem can contain textual
	  content, or it may be further wrapped in one or more
	  <tag>p</tag> elements.</para>

	<para>Definition lists contain definition terms
	  (<tag>dt</tag>) and definition descriptions
	  (<tag>dd</tag>).  A definition term can only contain inline
	  elements.  A definition description can contain other block
	  elements.</para>

	<example>
	  <title><tag>ul</tag> and <tag>ol</tag></title>

	  <para>Use:</para>

	  <programlisting><![CDATA[<p>An unordered list.  Listitems will probably be
  preceded by bullets.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First item</li>

  <li>Second item</li>

  <li>Third item</li>
</ul>

<p>An ordered list, with list items consisting of multiple
  paragraphs.  Each item (note: not each paragraph) will be
  numbered.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>This is the first item.  It only has one paragraph.</p></li>

  <li><p>This is the first paragraph of the second item.</p>

    <p>This is the second paragraph of the second item.</p></li>

  <li><p>This is the first and only paragraph of the third
    item.</p></li>
</ol>]]></programlisting>
	</example>

	<example>
	  <title>Definition lists with <tag>dl</tag></title>

	  <para>Use:</para>

	  <programlisting><![CDATA[<dl>
  <dt>Term 1</dt>

  <dd><p>Paragraph 1 of definition 1.</p>

    <p>Paragraph 2 of definition 1.</p></dd>

  <dt>Term 2</dt>

  <dd><p>Paragraph 1 of definition 2.</p></dd>

  <dt>Term 3</dt>

  <dd><p>Paragraph 1 of definition 3.</p></dd>
</dl>]]></programlisting>

      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Pre-formatted text</title>

	<para>You can indicate that text should be shown to the user exactly
	  as it is in the file.  Typically, this means that the text is shown
	  in a fixed font, multiple spaces are not merged into one, and line
	  breaks in the text are significant.</para>

	<para>In order to do this, wrap the content in the
	  <tag>pre</tag> element.</para>

	<example>
	  <title><tag>pre</tag></title>

	  <para>You could use <tag>pre</tag> to mark up an email
	    message:</para>

	  <programlisting><![CDATA[<pre>  From: nik@FreeBSD.org

	  <para>Keep in mind that <literal>&lt;</literal> and
	    <literal>&amp;</literal> still are recognized as special
	    characters in pre-formatted text.  This is why the example
	    shown had to use <literal>&amp;lt;</literal> instead of
	    <literal>&lt;</literal>.  For consistency,
	    <literal>&amp;gt;</literal> was used in place of
	    <literal>&gt;</literal>, too.  Watch out for the special characters
	    that may appear in text copied from a plain-text source,
	    e.g., an email message or program code.</para>

	<title>Tables</title>

	<note>
	  <para>Most text-mode browsers (such as Lynx) do not render tables
	    particularly effectively.  If you are relying on the tabular
	    display of your content, you should consider using alternative
	    markup to prevent confusion.</para>
	</note>

	<para>Mark up tabular information using the <tag>table</tag>
	  element.  A table consists of one or more table rows
	  (<tag>tr</tag>), each containing one or more cells of table
	  data (<tag>td</tag>).  Each cell can contain other block
	  elements, such as paragraphs or lists.  It can also contain another
	  table (this nesting can repeat indefinitely).  If the cell only
	  contains one paragraph then you do not need to include the
	  <tag>p</tag> element.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Simple use of <tag>table</tag></title>

	  <para>Use:</para>

	  <programlisting><![CDATA[<p>This is a simple 2x2 table.</p>

  <tr>
    <td>Bottom left cell</td>

    <td>Bottom right cell</td>
  </tr>
</table>]]></programlisting></example>

	<para>A cell can span multiple rows and columns.  To indicate this,
	  add the <literal>rowspan</literal> and/or <literal>colspan</literal>
	  attributes, with values indicating the number of rows of columns
	  that should be spanned.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Using <literal>rowspan</literal></title>

	<title>Emphasizing information</title>

	<para>You have two levels of emphasis available in HTML,
	  <tag>em</tag> and <tag>strong</tag>.
	  <tag>em</tag> is for a normal level of emphasis and
	  <tag>strong</tag> indicates stronger emphasis.</para>

	<para>Typically, <tag>em</tag> is rendered in italic and
	  <tag>strong</tag> is rendered in bold.  This is not always
	  the case, however, and you should not rely on it.</para>

	<example>

	<title>Bold and italics</title>

	<para>Because HTML includes presentational markup, you can also

	<title>Content size</title>

	<para>You can indicate that content should be shown in a larger or
	  smaller font.  There are three ways of doing this.</para>

	<orderedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>Use <tag>big</tag> and <tag>small</tag>
	      around the content you wish to change size.  These tags can be
	      nested, so <literal>&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;This is much
		bigger&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;</literal> is possible.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Use <tag>font</tag> with the <literal>size</literal>
	      attribute set to <literal>+1</literal> or <literal>-1</literal>
	      respectively.  This has the same effect as using
	      <tag>big</tag> or <tag>small</tag>.  However,
	      the use of this approach is deprecated.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>Use <tag>font</tag> with the <literal>size</literal>
	      attribute set to a number between 1 and 7.  The default font size
	      is <literal>3</literal>.  This approach is deprecated.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</orderedlist>

	<example>
	  <title><tag>big</tag>, <tag>small</tag>, and
	    <tag>font</tag></title>

	<title>Linking to other documents on the WWW</title>

	<para>In order to include a link to another document on the WWW you
	  must know the URL of the document you want to link to.</para>

	<para>The link is indicated with <tag>a</tag>, and the
	  <literal>href</literal> attribute contains the URL of the target
	  document.  The content of the element becomes the link, and is
	  normally indicated to the user in some way (underlining, change of
	  color, different mouse cursor when over the link, and so
	  on).</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Using <literal>&lt;a href="..."&gt;</literal></title>

      <sect3>
	<title>Linking to other parts of documents</title>

	<para>Linking to a point within another document (or within the same
	  document) requires that the document author include anchors that you
	  can link to.</para>

	<para>Anchors are indicated with <tag>a</tag> and the
	  <literal>name</literal> attribute instead of
	  <literal>href</literal>.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Using <literal>&lt;a name="..."&gt;</literal></title>

	  <para>Use:</para>

	  <programlisting><![CDATA[<p><a name="para1">This</a> paragraph can be referenced
  in other links with the name <tt>para1</tt>.</p>]]></programlisting>
	</example>

	<para>To link to a named part of a document, write a normal link to
	  that document, but include the name of the anchor after a
	  <literal>#</literal> symbol.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Linking to a named part of another document</title>

	  <para>Assume that the <literal>para1</literal> example resides in a

	<para>If you are linking to a named anchor within the same document
	  then you can omit the document's URL, and just include the name of

      <title>Document structure</title>

      <para>DocBook allows you to structure your documentation in several
	ways.  In the FreeBSD Documentation Project we are using two primary
	types of DocBook document: the book and the article.</para>

      <para>A book is organized into <tag>chapter</tag>s.  This is a
	mandatory requirement.  There may be <tag>part</tag>s between
	the book and the chapter to provide another layer of organization.
	The Handbook is arranged in this way.</para>

      <para>A chapter may (or may not) contain one or more sections.  These
	are indicated with the <tag>sect1</tag> element.  If a section
	contains another section then use the <tag>sect2</tag>
	element, and so on, up to <tag>sect5</tag>.</para>

      <para>Chapters and sections contain the remainder of the content.</para>

      <para>An article is simpler than a book, and does not use chapters.
	Instead, the content of an article is organized into one or more
	sections, using the same <tag>sect1</tag> (and
	<tag>sect2</tag> and so on) elements that are used in
	books.</para>

      <para>Obviously, you should consider the nature of the documentation you
	are writing in order to decide whether it is best marked up as a book
	or an article.  Articles are well suited to information that does not
	need to be broken down into several chapters, and that is, relatively
	speaking, quite short, at up to 20-25 pages of content.  Books are
	best suited to information that can be broken up into several
	chapters, possibly with appendices and similar content as well.</para>

      <para>The <link xlink:href="&url.base;/docs.html">FreeBSD
	  tutorials</link> are all marked up as articles, while this
	document, the <link xlink:href="&url.books.faq;/index.html">FreeBSD
	  FAQ</link>, and the <link xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/index.html">FreeBSD Handbook</link> are
	all marked up as books.</para>

      <sect3>
	<title>Starting a book</title>

	<para>The content of the book is contained within the
	  <tag>book</tag> element.  As well as containing structural
	  markup, this element can contain elements that include additional
	  information about the book.  This is either meta-information, used
	  for reference purposes, or additional content used to produce a
	  title page.</para>

	<para>This additional information should be contained within
	  <tag>bookinfo</tag>.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Boilerplate <tag>book</tag> with
	    <tag>bookinfo</tag></title>

	  <!-- Can't put this in a marked section because of the

	<title>Indicating chapters</title>

	<para>Use <tag>chapter</tag> to mark up your chapters.  Each

	<para>A chapter cannot be empty; it must contain elements in addition

	<title>Sections below chapters</title>

	<para>In books, chapters may (but do not need to) be broken up into
	  sections, subsections, and so on.  In articles, sections are the
	  main structural element, and each  article must contain at least one
	  section.  Use the
	  <tag>sect<replaceable>n</replaceable></tag> element.  The
	  <replaceable>n</replaceable> indicates the section number, which
	  identifies the section level.</para>

	<para>The first <tag>sect<replaceable>n</replaceable></tag> is
	  <tag>sect1</tag>.  You can have one or more of these in a
	  chapter.  They can contain one or more <tag>sect2</tag>
	  elements, and so on, down to <tag>sect5</tag>.</para>

	<para>Most of the time you will only need to use

	<para>A block quotation is an extended quotation from another document

	<title>Tips, notes, warnings, cautions, important information and

	<para>You may need to include extra information separate from the

	  information that the user should be aware of.</para>

	<para>Depending on the nature of the information, one of
	  <tag>tip</tag>, <tag>note</tag>,
	  <tag>warning</tag>, <tag>caution</tag>, and

	  information is related to the main text but is not one of the above,
	  use <tag>sidebar</tag>.</para>

	<para>The circumstances in which to choose one of these elements over
	  another is unclear.  The DocBook documentation suggests:</para>

	<para><tag>itemizedlist</tag> and

	<para><tag>procedure</tag> is slightly different.  It consists
	  of <tag>step</tag>s, which may in turn consists of more

	<title>Tables</title>

	<para>Unlike HTML, you do not need to use tables for layout purposes,
	  as the stylesheet handles those issues for you.  Instead, just use
	  tables for marking up tabular data.</para>

	<para>In general terms (and see the DocBook documentation for more
	  detail) a table (which can be either formal or informal) consists of
	  a <tag>table</tag> element.  This contains at least one
	  <tag>tgroup</tag> element, which specifies (as an attribute)
	  the number of columns in this table group.  Within the tablegroup
	  you can then have one <tag>thead</tag> element, which
	  contains elements for the table headings (column headings), and one
	  <tag>tbody</tag> which contains the body of the
	  table.</para>

	<para>Both <tag>tgroup</tag> and <tag>thead</tag>
	  contain <tag>row</tag> elements, which in turn contain
	  <tag>entry</tag> elements.  Each <tag>entry</tag>

	<title>Applications, commands, options, and cites</title>

	<para>You will frequently want to refer to both applications and
	  commands when writing for the Handbook.  The distinction between
	  them is simple: an application is the name for a suite (or possibly
	  just 1) of programs that fulfil a particular task.  A command is the
	  name of a program that the user can run.</para>

	<para>In addition, you will occasionally need to list one or more of
	  the options that a command might take.</para>

	<para>Finally, you will often want to list a command with its manual
	  section number, in the <quote>command(number)</quote> format so
	  common in Unix manuals.</para>

	<para>Mark up application names with
	  <tag>application</tag>.</para>

	<para>When you want to list a command with its manual section number
	  (which should be most of the time) the DocBook element is
	  <tag>citerefentry</tag>.  This will contain a further two
	  elements, <tag>refentrytitle</tag> and
	  <tag>manvolnum</tag>.  The content of
	  <tag>refentrytitle</tag> is the name of the command, and the
	  content of <tag>manvolnum</tag> is the manual page
	  section.</para>

	<para>This can be cumbersome to write, and so a series of <link linkend="sgml-primer-general-entities">general entities</link>
	  have been created to make this easier.  Each entity takes the form
	  <literal>&amp;man.manual-page.manual-section;</literal>.</para>

	<para>The file that contains these entities is in
	  <filename>doc/share/xml/man-refs.ent</filename>, and can be
	  referred to using this FPI:</para>

	<programlisting>PUBLIC "-//FreeBSD//ENTITIES DocBook Manual Page Entities//EN"</programlisting>

	<para>Therefore, the introduction to your documentation will probably
	  look like this:</para>

	<programlisting>&lt;!DOCTYPE book PUBLIC "-//FreeBSD//DTD DocBook V4.1-Based Extension//EN" [

&lt;!ENTITY % man PUBLIC "-//FreeBSD//ENTITIES DocBook Manual Page Entities//EN"&gt;
%man;

&hellip;

]&gt;</programlisting>

	<para>Use <tag>command</tag> when you want to include a
	  command name <quote>in-line</quote> but present it as something the
	  user should type in.</para>

	<para>Use <tag>option</tag> to mark up the options
	  which will be passed to a command.</para>

	<para>When referring to the same command multiple times in
	  close proximity it is preferred to use the
	  <literal>&amp;man.command.section;</literal>
	  notation to markup the first reference and use
	  <tag>command</tag> to markup subsequent references.
	  This makes the generated output, especially HTML, appear
	  visually better.</para>

	<para>This can be confusing, and sometimes the choice is not always
	  clear.  Hopefully this example makes it clearer.</para>

	<para><tag>maketarget</tag> identifies a build target exported

      <title>Images</title>

      <important>
	<para>Image support in the documentation is currently extremely
	  experimental.  I think the mechanisms described here are unlikely to
	  change, but that is not guaranteed.</para>

	<para>You will also need to install the
	  <package>graphics/ImageMagick</package> port, which is used to
	  convert between the different image formats.  This is a big port,
	  and most of it is not required.  However, while we are working on the
	  <filename>Makefile</filename>s and other infrastructure it makes
	  things easier.  This port is <emphasis>not</emphasis> in the
	  <package>textproc/docproj</package> meta port, you must install it
	  by hand.</para>

	<para>The best example of what follows in practice is the
	  <filename>doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/vm-design/</filename> document.
	  If you are unsure of the description that follows, take a look at the
	  files in that directory to see how everything hangs together.
	  Experiment with creating different formatted versions of the
	  document to see how the image markup appears in the formatted
	  output.</para>
      </important>

      <sect3>
	<title>Image formats</title>

	<para>We currently support two formats for images.  The format you
	  should use will depend on the nature of your image.</para>

	<para>For images that are primarily vector based, such as network
	  diagrams, time lines, and similar, use Encapsulated Postscript, and
	  make sure that your images have the <filename>.eps</filename>
	  extension.</para>

	<para>For bitmaps, such as screen captures, use the Portable Network
	  Graphic format, and make sure that your images have the
	  <filename>.png</filename> extension.</para>

	<para>These are the <emphasis>only</emphasis> formats in which images
	  should be committed to the CVS repository.</para>

	<para>Use the right format for the right image.  It is to be expected
	  that your documentation will have a mix of EPS and PNG images.  The
	  <filename>Makefile</filename>s ensure that the correct format image
	  is chosen depending on the output format that you use for your
	  documentation.  <emphasis>Do not commit the same image to the
	    repository in two different formats</emphasis>.</para>

	<important>
	  <para>It is anticipated that the Documentation Project will switch to
	    using the Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) format for vector images.
	    However, the current state of SVG capable editing tools makes this
	    impractical.</para>
	</important>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title>Markup</title>

	<para>The markup for an image is relatively simple.  First, markup a
	  <tag>mediaobject</tag>.  The <tag>mediaobject</tag>
	  can contain other, more specific objects.  We are concerned with
	  two, the <tag>imageobject</tag> and the
	  <tag>textobject</tag>.</para>

	<para>You should include one <tag>imageobject</tag>, and two
	  <tag>textobject</tag> elements.  The
	  <tag>imageobject</tag> will point to the name of the image
	  file that will be used (without the extension).  The
	  <tag>textobject</tag> elements contain information that will
	  be presented to the user as well as, or instead of, the
	  image.</para>

	<para>There are two circumstances where this can happen.</para>

	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>When the reader is viewing the documentation in HTML.  In
	      this case, each image will need to have associated alternate
	      text to show the user, typically whilst the image is loading, or
	      if they hover the mouse pointer over the image.</para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>When the reader is viewing the documentation in plain text.
	      In this case, each image should have an ASCII art equivalent to
	      show the user.</para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

	<para>An example will probably make things easier to understand.
	  Suppose you have an image, called <filename>fig1.png</filename>, that
	  you want to include in the document.  This image is of a rectangle
	  with an A inside it.  The markup for this would be as
	  follows.</para>

	<programlisting>&lt;mediaobject&gt;
  &lt;imageobject&gt;
    &lt;imagedata fileref="fig1"&gt; <co xml:id="co-image-ext"/>
  &lt;/imageobject&gt;

  &lt;textobject&gt;
    &lt;literallayout class="monospaced"&gt;+---------------+ <co xml:id="co-image-literal"/>
|       A       |
+---------------+&lt;/literallayout&gt;
  &lt;/textobject&gt;

  &lt;textobject&gt;
    &lt;phrase&gt;A picture&lt;/phrase&gt; <co xml:id="co-image-phrase"/>
  &lt;/textobject&gt;
&lt;/mediaobject&gt;</programlisting>

	<calloutlist>
	  <callout arearefs="co-image-ext">
	    <para>Include an <tag>imagedata</tag> element inside the
	      <tag>imageobject</tag> element.  The
	      <literal>fileref</literal> attribute should contain the filename
	      of the image to include, without the extension.  The stylesheets
	      will work out which extension should be added to the filename
	      automatically.</para>
	  </callout>

	  <callout arearefs="co-image-literal">
	    <para>The first <tag>textobject</tag> should contain a

	      demonstrate your ASCII art skills.  This content will be used if
	      the document is converted to plain text.</para>

	    <para>Notice how the first and last lines of the content of the
	      <tag>literallayout</tag> element butt up next to the
	      element's tags.  This ensures no extraneous white space is

	  <callout arearefs="co-image-phrase">

      </sect3>

      <sect3>
	<title><filename>Makefile</filename> entries</title>

	<para>Your images must be listed in the
	  <filename>Makefile</filename> in the <varname>IMAGES</varname>
	  variable.  This variable should contain the name of all your
	  <emphasis>source</emphasis> images.  For example, if you have
	  created three figures, <filename>fig1.eps</filename>,
	  <filename>fig2.png</filename>, <filename>fig3.png</filename>, then
	  your <filename>Makefile</filename> should have lines like this in

	<programlisting>&hellip;

&hellip;</programlisting>

	<para>or</para>

	<programlisting>&hellip;
IMAGES=  fig1.eps
IMAGES+= fig2.png
IMAGES+= fig3.png
&hellip;</programlisting>

	<para>Again, the <filename>Makefile</filename> will work out the

	  only need to list the image files <emphasis>you</emphasis>
	  provided.</para>

	<title>Images and chapters in subdirectories</title>

	<para>You must be careful when you separate your documentation into
	  smaller files (see <xref linkend="sgml-primer-include-using-gen-entities"/>) in
	  different directories.</para>

	<para>Suppose you have a book with three chapters, and the chapters
	  are stored in their own directories, called
	  <filename>chapter1/chapter.xml</filename>,
	  <filename>chapter2/chapter.xml</filename>, and
	  <filename>chapter3/chapter.xml</filename>.  If each chapter has
	  images associated with it, I suggest you place those images in each
	  chapter's subdirectory (<filename>chapter1/</filename>,
	  <filename>chapter2/</filename>, and
	  <filename>chapter3/</filename>).</para>

	<para>However, if you do this you must include the directory names in
	  the <varname>IMAGES</varname> variable in the
	  <filename>Makefile</filename>, <emphasis>and</emphasis> you must
	  include the directory name in the <tag>imagedata</tag>
	  element in your document.</para>

	<para>For example, if you have <filename>chapter1/fig1.png</filename>,
	  then <filename>chapter1/chapter.xml</filename> should
	  contain:</para>

	<programlisting>&lt;mediaobject&gt;
  &lt;imageobject&gt;
    &lt;imagedata fileref="chapter1/fig1"&gt; <co xml:id="co-image-dir"/>
  &lt;/imageobject&gt;

  &hellip;

&lt;/mediaobject&gt;</programlisting>

	<calloutlist>
	  <callout arearefs="co-image-dir">
	    <para>The directory name must be included in the
	      <literal>fileref</literal> attribute.</para>

	</calloutlist>

	<para>The <filename>Makefile</filename> must contain:</para>

	<programlisting>&hellip;
IMAGES=  chapter1/fig1.png

      <sect3>
	<title>Linking to other parts of the same document</title>

	<para>Linking within the same document requires you to specify
	  where you are linking from (i.e., the text the user will click, or
	  otherwise indicate, as the source of the link) and where you are
	  linking to (the link's destination).</para>

	<para>Each element within DocBook has an attribute called
	  <literal>id</literal>.  You can place text in this attribute to
	  uniquely name the element it is attached to.</para>

	  <para>This value will be used when you specify the link
	  source.</para>

	<para>Normally, you will only be linking to chapters or sections, so
	  you would add the <literal>id</literal> attribute to these
	  elements.</para>

	<example>
	  <title><literal>id on chapters and sections</literal></title>

	  <programlisting><![CDATA[<chapter id="chapter1">
  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This is the introduction.  It contains a subsection,
    which is identified as well.</para>

  <sect1 id="chapter1-sect1">
    <title>Sub-sect 1</title>

    <para>This is the subsection.</para>
  </sect1>
</chapter>]]></programlisting>
	</example>

	<para>Obviously, you should use more descriptive values.  The values
	  must be unique within the document (i.e., not just the file, but the
	  document the file might be included in as well).  Notice how the
	  <literal>id</literal> for the subsection is constructed by appending
	  text to the <literal>id</literal> of the chapter.  This helps to
	  ensure that they are unique.</para>

	<para>If you want to allow the user to jump into a specific portion of
	  the document (possibly in the middle of a paragraph or an example),
	  use <tag>anchor</tag>.  This element has no content, but
	  takes an <literal>id</literal> attribute.</para>

	<example>
	  <title><tag>anchor</tag></title>

	  <programlisting><![CDATA[<para>This paragraph has an embedded
  <anchor id="para1">link target in it.  It will not show up in
  the document.</para>]]></programlisting>
	</example>

	<para>When you want to provide the user with a link they can activate
	  (probably by clicking) to go to a section of the document that has
	  an <literal>id</literal> attribute, you can use either
	  <tag>xref</tag> or <tag>link</tag>.</para>

	<para>Both of these elements have a <literal>linkend</literal>
	  attribute.  The value of this attribute should be the value that you
	  have used in a <literal>id</literal> attribute (it does not matter
	  if that value has not yet occurred in your document; this will work
	  for forward links as well as backward links).</para>

	<para>If you use <tag>xref</tag> then you have no control over
	  the text of the link.  It will be generated for you.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Using <tag>xref</tag></title>

	  <para>Assume that this fragment appears somewhere in a document that
	    includes the <literal>id</literal> example:</para>

	  <programlisting><![CDATA[<para>More information can be found
  in <xref linkend="chapter1">.</para>

<para>More specific information can be found
  in <xref linkend="chapter1-sect1">.</para>]]></programlisting>

	  <para>The text of the link will be generated automatically, and will
	    look like (<emphasis>emphasized</emphasis> text indicates the text
	    that will be the link):</para>

	  <blockquote>
	    <para>More information can be found in <emphasis>Chapter
		One</emphasis>.</para>

	    <para>More specific information can be found in <emphasis>the
		section called Sub-sect 1</emphasis>.</para>
	  </blockquote>
	</example>

	<para>Notice how the text from the link is derived from the section
	  title or the chapter number.</para>

	<note>
	  <para>This means that you <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> use
	    <tag>xref</tag> to link to an <literal>id</literal>
	    attribute on an <tag>anchor</tag> element.  The
	    <tag>anchor</tag> has no content, so the
	    <tag>xref</tag> cannot generate the text for the
	    link.</para>
	</note>

	<para>If you want to control the text of the link then use
	  <tag>link</tag>.  This element wraps content, and the
	  content will be used for the link.</para>

	<example>
	  <title>Using <tag>link</tag></title>

	  <para>Assume that this fragment appears somewhere in a document that
	    includes the <literal>id</literal> example.</para>

	  <programlisting><![CDATA[<para>More information can be found in
  <link linkend="chapter1">the first chapter</link>.</para>

<para>More specific information can be found in
  <link linkend="chapter1-sect1">this</link> section.</para>]]></programlisting>

	  <para>This will generate the following
