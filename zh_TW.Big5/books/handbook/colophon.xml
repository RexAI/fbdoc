  <para>This book is the combined work of hundreds of contributors to

    authored in SGML
    according to the DocBook DTD and is formatted from SGML into many
    different presentation formats using <application>Jade</application>,
    an open source DSSSL
    engine.  Norm Walsh's DSSSL stylesheets were used with an
    additional customization layer to provide the presentation
    instructions for <application>Jade</application>.  The printed
    version of this document would not be possible without Donald
    Knuth's &tex; typesetting language,
