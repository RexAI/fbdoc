	<question xml:id="what-is-FreeBSD">
	  <para>What is &os;?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>&os; is a modern operating system for desktops,
	    laptops, servers, and embedded systems with
	    support for a large number of  <link xlink:href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/platforms/">platforms</link>.</para>

	  <para>It is based on U.C.
	    Berkeley's <quote>4.4BSD-Lite</quote> release, with some
	    <quote>4.4BSD-Lite2</quote> enhancements.  It is also based
	    indirectly on William Jolitz's port of U.C. Berkeley's
	    <quote>Net/2</quote> to the &i386;, known as
	    <quote>386BSD</quote>, though very little of the 386BSD code
	    remains.</para>

	  <para>&os; is used by companies, Internet Service Providers,
	    researchers, computer professionals, students and home users
	    all over the world in their work, education and
	    recreation.</para>

	  <para>For more detailed information on &os;, please see the
	    <link xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/index.html">&os; Handbook</link>.</para>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="FreeBSD-goals">
	  <para>What is the goal of the &os; Project?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The goal of the &os; Project is to provide a
	    stable and fast general purpose
	    operating system that may
	    be used for any purpose
	    without strings attached.</para>

      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="bsd-license-restrictions">
	  <para>Does the &os; license have any restrictions?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Yes.  Those restrictions do not control how you use the
	    code, merely how you treat the &os; Project itself.  If you
	    have serious license concerns, read the actual <link xlink:href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/copyright/freebsd-license.html">license</link>.
	    For the simply curious, the license can be summarized like
	    this.</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Do not claim that you wrote this.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Do not sue us if it breaks.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Do not remove or modify the license.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>Many of us have a significant investment in the
	    project
	    and would certainly not mind a little financial
	    compensation now and then, but we definitely do not insist
	    on it.  We believe that our first and foremost
	    <quote>mission</quote> is to provide code to any and all
	    comers, and for whatever purpose, so that the code gets
	    the
	    widest possible use and provides the widest possible
	    benefit.  This, we believe, is one of the most
	    fundamental
	    goals of Free Software and one that we enthusiastically
	    support.</para>

	  <para>Code in our source tree which falls under the
	    <link xlink:href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/copyright/COPYING">GNU General Public License (GPL)</link>
	    or <link xlink:href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/copyright/COPYING.LIB">GNU Library General Public License (LGPL)</link>
	    comes with slightly more strings attached, though at least
	    on the side of enforced access rather than the usual
	    opposite.  Due to the additional complexities that can
	    evolve in the commercial use of GPL software, we do,
	    however, endeavor to replace such software with submissions
	    under the more relaxed <link xlink:href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/copyright/freebsd-license.html">&os; license</link>
	    whenever possible.</para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="replace-current-OS">
	  <para>Can &os; replace my current operating system?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>For most people, yes.  But this question is not quite
	    that cut-and-dried.</para>

	  <para>Most people do not actually use an operating system.
	    They use applications.  The applications are what really use
	    the operating system.  &os; is designed to provide a robust
	    and full-featured environment for applications.  It supports
	    a wide variety of web browsers, office suites, email
	    readers, graphics programs, programming environments,
	    network servers, and just about everything else you might
	    want.  Most of these applications can be managed through the
	    <link xlink:href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/ports/">Ports Collection</link>.</para>

	  <para>If you need to use an application that is only available
	    on one operating system, you simply cannot replace that
	    operating system.  Chances are there is a very similar
	    application on &os;, however.  If you want a solid office or
	    Internet server, a reliable workstation, or just the ability
	    to do your job without interruptions, &os; will almost
	    certainly do everything you need.  Many computer users
	    across the world, including both novices and experienced
	    &unix; administrators, use &os; as their only desktop
	    operating system.</para>

	  <para>If you are migrating to &os; from some other &unix;
	    environment, you already know most of what you need to.  If
	    your background is in graphic-driven operating systems such
	    as &windows; and &macos;, you may be interested in using
	    <link xlink:href="http://www.pcbsd.org/">PC-BSD</link>, a &os; based
	    distribution, instead.  If you have not used &unix; before
	    expect to invest
	    additional time learning the &unix; way of doing things.
	    This FAQ and the <link xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/index.html">&os; Handbook</link>
	    are excellent places to start.</para>
	</answer>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="why-called-FreeBSD">
	  <para>Why is it called &os;?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>It may be used free of charge, even by commercial
		users.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Full source for the operating system is freely
		available, and the minimum possible restrictions have
		been placed upon its use, distribution and incorporation
		into other work (commercial or non-commercial).</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>Anyone who has an improvement or bug fix is free to
		submit their code and have it added to the source tree
		(subject to one or two obvious provisions).</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>It is worth pointing out that the word
	    <quote>free</quote> is being used in two ways here, one
	    meaning <quote>at no cost</quote>, the other meaning
	    <quote>you can do whatever you like</quote>.  Apart from one
	    or two things you <emphasis>cannot</emphasis> do with the
	    &os; code, for example pretending you wrote it, you can
	    really do whatever you like with it.</para>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="differences-to-other-bsds">
	  <para>What are the differences between &os; and NetBSD,
	    OpenBSD, and other open source BSD operating systems?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>James Howard wrote a good explanation of the history and
	    differences between the various projects,
	    called <link xlink:href="http://www.freebsdworld.gr/freebsd/bsd-family-tree.html">The BSD Family Tree</link>
	    which goes a fair way to answering this question.
	    Some of the information is out of date, but the history
	    portion in particular remains accurate.</para>

	  <para>Most of the BSDs share patches and code, even today.
	    All of the BSDs have common ancestry.</para>

	  <para>The design goals of &os; are described in
	    <xref linkend="FreeBSD-goals"/>, above.  The design goals
	    of the other most popular BSDs may be summarized as
	    follows:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>OpenBSD aims for operating system security above
		all else.  The OpenBSD team wrote &man.ssh.1; and
		&man.pf.4;, which have both been ported to &os;.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>NetBSD aims to be easily ported to other hardware
		platforms.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>DragonFly&nbsp;BSD is a fork of &os;&nbsp;4.8 that has
		since developed many interesting features of its own,
		including the HAMMER file system and support for

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="latest-version">
	  <para>What is the latest version of &os;?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>At any point in the development of &os;, there can be
	    multiple parallel branches.  &rel.relx; releases are
	    made from the &rel.stable; branch, and &rel2.relx;
	    releases are made from the &rel2.stable; branch.</para>

	  <para>Up until the release of 9.0, the
	    &rel2.relx; series was the one known as
	    <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis>.  However, as of
	    &rel.head.relx;, the
	    &rel2.relx; branch will be designated for
	    an <quote>extended support</quote> status and receive only
	    fixes for major problems, such as security-related fixes.
	    <!--There will be no more releases made from the
	    &rel2.stable; branch, and it is considered a
	    <quote>legacy</quote> branch and most current work will only
	    become a part of &rel.stable; and &rel2.stable;.--></para>

	  <para>Version <link xlink:href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/i386/&rel.current;-RELEASE/">&rel.current;</link>
	    is the latest release from the &rel.stable;
	    branch; it was released in &rel.current.date;.  Version
	    <link xlink:href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/releases/i386/&rel2.current;-RELEASE/">&rel2.current;</link>
	    is the latest release from the &rel2.stable;
	    branch; it was released in &rel2.current.date;.</para>

	  <para>Briefly, <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis> is aimed at the
	    ISP, corporate user, or any user who wants stability and a
	    minimal number of changes compared to the new (and possibly
	    unstable) features of the latest
	    <emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> snapshot.  Releases can come
	    from either branch, but <emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> should
	    only be used if you are prepared for its increased
	    volatility (relative to <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis>, that
	    is).</para>

	  <para>Releases are made <link linkend="release-freq">every few months</link>.  While
	    many people stay more up-to-date with the &os; sources (see
	    the questions on <link linkend="current">&os.current;</link> and <link linkend="stable">&os.stable;</link>) than that, doing so
	    is more of a commitment, as the sources are a moving
	    target.</para>

	  <para>More information on &os; releases can be found on the
	    <link xlink:href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releng/index.html#release-build">Release Engineering page</link>
	    and in &man.release.7;.</para>

      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="current">
	  <para>What is <emphasis>&os;-CURRENT</emphasis>?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para><link xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/current-stable.html#current">&os.current;</link>
	    is the development version of the operating system, which
	    will in due course become the new &os.stable; branch.  As
	    such, it is really only of interest to developers working on
	    the system and die-hard hobbyists.  See the <link xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/current-stable.html#current">relevant section</link>
	    in the <link xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/index.html">Handbook</link> for
	    details on running <emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis>.</para>

	  <para>If you are not familiar with &os;
	    you should not use
	    &os.current;.  This branch sometimes evolves quite quickly
	    and due to mistake can be un-buildable at times.
	    People that use &os.current; are expected to be able to
	    analyze, debug, and report problems.</para>

	  <para>&os; <link xlink:href="&url.base;/snapshots/">snapshot</link>
	    releases are made based on the current state of the
	    <emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> and
	    <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis> branches.  The goals behind
	    each snapshot release are:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>To test the latest version of the installation
		software.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>To give people who would like to run
		<emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> or
		<emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis> but who do not have the
		time or bandwidth to follow it on a day-to-day basis an
		easy way of bootstrapping it onto their systems.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>To preserve a fixed reference point for the code in
		question, just in case we break something really badly
		later.  (Although Subversion normally prevents anything
		horrible like this happening.)</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>To ensure that all new features and fixes in need of
		testing have the greatest possible number of potential
		testers.</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>No claims are made that any
	    <emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> snapshot can be considered
	    <quote>production quality</quote> for any purpose.  If you
	    want to run a stable and fully tested system, you will have
	    to stick to full releases, or use the
	    <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis> snapshots.</para>

	  <para>Snapshot releases are directly available from <link xlink:href="&url.base;/snapshots/">snapshot</link>.</para>

	  <para>Official snapshots are generated on a regular
	    basis for all actively developed branches.</para>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="stable">
	  <para>What is the <emphasis>&os;-STABLE</emphasis>
	    concept?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Back when &os;&nbsp;2.0.5 was released, &os; development
	    branched in two.  One branch was named <link xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/current-stable.html#stable">-STABLE</link>,
	    one <link xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/current-stable.html#current">-CURRENT</link>.
	    <emphasis>&os;-STABLE</emphasis> is intended for Internet
	    Service Providers and other commercial enterprises for whom
	    sudden shifts or experimental features are quite
	    undesirable.  It receives only well-tested bug fixes and
	    other small incremental enhancements.
	    <emphasis>&os;-CURRENT</emphasis>, on the other hand, has
	    been one unbroken line since 2.0 was released, leading
	    towards &rel.current;-RELEASE and beyond.  For more detailed
	    information on branches see <quote><link xlink:href="&url.articles.releng;/release-proc.html#rel-branch">&os; Release Engineering: Creating the Release Branch</link></quote>,
	    the status of the branches and the upcoming release schedule
	    can be found on the <link xlink:href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releng">Release Engineering Information</link> page.</para>

	  <para>&rel.current;-STABLE is the actively developed
	    <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis> branch.  The latest release on
	    the &rel.current;-STABLE branch is &rel.current;-RELEASE,
	    which was released in &rel.current.date;.</para>

	  <para>The &rel.head; branch is the actively developed
	    <emphasis>-CURRENT</emphasis> branch toward the next
	    generation of &os;.  See <link linkend="current">What is &os;-CURRENT?</link> for more
	    information on this branch.</para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="release-freq">
	  <para>When are &os; releases made?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The &a.re; releases a new major version of &os; about
	    every 18 months and a new minor version about every 8 months,
	    on average.  Release dates are announced well in advance, so
	    that the people working on the system know when their
	    projects need to be finished and tested.  A testing period
	    precedes each release, to ensure that the addition
	    of new features does not compromise the stability of the
	    release.  Many users regard this caution as one of the best
	    things about &os;, even though waiting for all the latest
	    goodies to reach <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis> can be a
	    little frustrating.</para>

	  <para>More information on the release engineering process
	    (including a schedule of upcoming releases) can be found on
	    the <link xlink:href="http://www.FreeBSD.org/releng/index.html">release engineering</link>
	    pages on the &os; Web site.</para>

	  <para>For people who need or want a little more excitement,
	    binary snapshots are made weekly as discussed above.</para>

      <qandaentry>
	<question xml:id="responsible">
	  <para>Who is responsible for &os;?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The key decisions concerning the &os; project, such as
	    the overall direction of the project and who is allowed to
	    add code to the source tree, are made by a <link xlink:href="&url.base;/administration.html#t-core">core team</link> of
	    9 people.  There is a much larger team of more than 350
	    <link xlink:href="&url.articles.contributors;/article.html#staff-committers">committers</link>
	    who are authorized to make changes directly to the &os;
	    source tree.</para>

	  <para>However, most non-trivial changes are discussed in
	    advance in the <link linkend="mailing">mailing lists</link>,

	  <para>For example, the split HTML version of the FAQ,
	    compressed using &man.bzip2.1;, can be found in
	    <filename>doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/book.html-split.tar.bz2</filename>
	    To download and uncompress that file you would have

	  <para>If the file is compressed,
	    <application>tar</application> will automatically
	    detect the appropriate format and decompress it correctly.
	    You will be left with a collection of
	    <filename>.html</filename> files.  The main one is called
	    <filename>index.html</filename>, which will contain the
	    table of contents, introductory material, and links to the

	  <para>I booted from my ATAPI CD-ROM, but the install program

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The usual cause of this problem is a mis-configured
	    CD-ROM drive.  Many PCs now ship with the CD-ROM as the slave
	    device on the secondary IDE controller, with no master
	    device on that controller.  This is illegal according to the
	    ATAPI specification, but &windows; plays fast and loose with
	    the specification, and the BIOS ignores it when booting.
	    This is why the BIOS was able to see the CD-ROM to boot from
	    it, but why &os; cannot see it to complete the
	    install.</para>

	  <para>Reconfigure your system so that the CD-ROM is either the
	    master device on the IDE controller it is attached to, or
	    make sure that it is the slave on an IDE controller that

	<answer>
	  <para>&os;&nbsp;7 and 8 use MD5 password hashing by

	    These are

	<question xml:id="ffs-limits">
	  <para>What are the limits for FFS file systems?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>For FFS file systems, the largest file system is practically
	    limited by the amount of memory required to &man.fsck.8; the file
	    system.  &man.fsck.8; requires one bit per fragment, which with
	    the default fragment size of 4&nbsp;KB equates to 32&nbsp;MB
	    of memory per TB of disk.  This does mean that on architectures
	    which limit userland processes to 2&nbsp;GB (e.g., &i386;),
	    the maximum &man.fsck.8;'able filesystem is ~60&nbsp;TB.</para>

	  <para>If there was not a &man.fsck.8; memory limit the maximum
	    filesystem size would be 2&nbsp;^&nbsp;64 (blocks) * 32&nbsp;KB
	    => 16 Exa * 32&nbsp;KB => 512 ZettaBytes.</para>

	  <para>The maximum size of a single FFS file is approximately
	    2&nbsp;PB with the default block size of 32&nbsp;KB.  Each
	    32&nbsp;KB block can point to 4096 blocks.  With triple
	    indirect blocks, the calculation is 32&nbsp;KB * 12 +
	    32&nbsp;KB * 4096 + 32&nbsp;KB * 4096^2 + 32&nbsp;KB *
	    4096^3.  Increasing the block size to 64&nbsp;KB will increase
	    the max file size by a factor of 16.</para>

	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>Yes.  &os; as an operating system generally supports
	      as much physical memory (RAM) as the platform it is running

	      memory (and usually less than that because of PCI address
	      space) and &i386; with PAE supports at most 64&nbsp;GB
	      memory.  AMD64 platforms currently deployed support up to
	      1&nbsp;TB of physical memory.</para>

	  <question xml:id="memory-i386-over-4gb">
	    <para>Why does &os; report less than 4&nbsp;GB memory when
	      installed on an &i386; machine?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>The total address space on &i386; machines is 32-bit,
	      meaning that at most 4&nbsp;GB of memory is addressable (can
	      be accessed).  Furthermore, some addresses in this range
	      are reserved by hardware for different purposes, for
	      example for using and controlling PCI devices, for
	      accessing video memory, and so on.  Therefore, the total
	      amount of memory usable by the operating system for its
	      kernel and applications is limited to significantly less
	      than 4&nbsp;GB.  Usually, 3.2&nbsp;GB to 3.7&nbsp;GB is
	      the maximum usable physical memory in this
	      configuration.</para>

	    <para>To access more than 3.2&nbsp;GB to 3.7&nbsp;GB of
	      installed memory (meaning up to 4&nbsp;GB but also more than
	      4&nbsp;GB), a special tweak called <acronym>PAE</acronym>
	      must be used.  PAE stands for Physical Address Extension
	      and is a way for 32-bit x86 CPUs to address more than
	      4&nbsp;GB of memory.  It remaps the memory that would
	      otherwise be overlaid by address reservations for
	      hardware devices above the 4&nbsp;GB range and uses it as
	      additional physical memory (see &man.pae.4;).  Using PAE
	      has some drawbacks; this mode of memory access is a little
	      bit slower than the normal (without PAE) mode and loadable
	      modules (see &man.kld.4;) are not supported.  This means
	      all drivers must be compiled into the kernel.</para>

	    <para>The most common way to enable PAE is to build a new
	      kernel with the special ready-provided kernel configuration
	      file called <filename>PAE</filename>, which is already
	      configured to build a safe kernel.  Note that some entries
	      in this kernel configuration file are too conservative and
	      some drivers marked as unready to be used with PAE are
	      actually usable.  A rule of thumb is that if the driver is
	      usable on 64-bit architectures (like AMD64), it is also
	      usable with PAE.  If you wish to create your own kernel
	      configuration file, you can enable PAE by adding the
	      following line to your configuration:</para>

	    <programlisting>options       PAE</programlisting>

	    <para>PAE is not much used nowadays because most new x86
	      hardware also supports running in 64-bit mode, known as
	      AMD64 or &intel;&nbsp;64.  It has a much larger address
	      space and does not need such tweaks.  &os; supports AMD64
	      and it is recommended that this version of &os; be used
	      instead of the &i386; version if 4&nbsp;GB or more memory
	      is required.</para>

	<question xml:id="pae">
	  <para>Why is &os; finding the wrong amount of memory on &i386;
	    hardware?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The most likely reason is the difference between
	    physical memory addresses and virtual addresses.</para>

	  <para>The convention for most PC hardware is to use the memory
	    area between 3.5&nbsp;GB and 4&nbsp;GB for a special purpose
	    (usually for PCI).  This address space is used to access PCI
	    hardware.  As a result real, physical memory can not be
	    accessed by that address space.</para>

	  <para>What happens to the memory that should appear in that
	    location is dependent on your hardware.  Unfortunately, some
	    hardware does nothing and the ability to use that last
	    500&nbsp;MB of RAM is entirely lost.</para>

	  <para>Luckily, most hardware remaps the memory to a higher
	    location so that it can still be used.  However, this can
	    cause some confusion if you watch the boot messages.</para>

	  <para>On a 32-bit version of &os;, the memory appears
	    lost, since it will be remapped above 4&nbsp;GB, which a
	    32-bit kernel is unable to access.  In this case, the
	    solution is to build a PAE enabled kernel.  See <link linkend="memory-limits">the entry on memory limits</link>
	    and <link linkend="memory-upper-limitation">about different
	    memory limits on different platforms</link> for more
	    information.</para>

	  <para>On a 64-bit version of &os;, or when running a
	    PAE-enabled kernel, &os; will correctly detect and remap the
	    memory so it is usable.  During boot, however, it may seem
	    as if &os; is detecting more memory than the system really
	    has, due to the described remapping.  This is normal and the
	    available memory will be corrected as the boot process
	    completes.</para>

	<question xml:id="signal11">
	  <para>Why do my programs occasionally die with
	    <errorname>Signal 11</errorname> errors?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Signal 11 errors are caused when your process has
	    attempted to access memory which the operating system has not
	    granted it access to.  If something like this is happening
	    at seemingly random intervals then you need to start
	    investigating things very carefully.</para>

	  <para>These problems can usually be attributed to
	    either:</para>

	  <orderedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>If the problem is occurring only in a specific
		application that you are developing yourself it is
		probably a bug in your code.</para>
	    </listitem>

	    <listitem>
	      <para>If it is a problem with part of the base &os;
		system, it may also be buggy code, but more often than not
		these problems are found and fixed long before us
		general FAQ readers get to use these bits of code (that
		is what -CURRENT is for).</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </orderedlist>

	  <para>In particular, a dead giveaway that this is
	    <emphasis>not</emphasis> a &os; bug is if you see the
	    problem when you are compiling a program, but the activity
	    that the compiler is carrying out changes each time.</para>

	  <para>For example, suppose you are running
	    <command>make buildworld</command>,
	    and the compile fails while trying to compile
	    <filename>ls.c</filename> into <filename>ls.o</filename>.
	    If you then run
	    <command>make buildworld</command>
	    again, and the compile fails in the same place then this is
	    a broken build &mdash; try updating your sources and try
	    again.  If the compile fails elsewhere then this is almost
	    certainly hardware.</para>

	  <para>What you should do:</para>

	  <para>In the first case you can use a debugger e.g.,
	    &man.gdb.1; to find the point in the program which is
	    attempting to access a bogus address and then fix it.</para>

	  <para>In the second case you need to verify that it is not
	    your hardware at fault.</para>

	  <para>Common causes of this include:</para>

	  <orderedlist>

	      <para>Your hard disks might be overheating: Check the fans
		in your case are still working, as your disk (and perhaps

	    <listitem>
	      <para>The processor running is overheating: This might be
		because the processor has been overclocked, or the fan

		need to ensure that you have hardware running at what it
		is specified to run at, at least while trying to solve
		this problem (in other words, clock it back to the default
		settings.)</para>

	      <para>If you are overclocking then note that it is far
		cheaper to have a slow system than a fried system that

		power supply, preferably one with a little more power
		(for instance, if your current power supply is rated at
		250&nbsp;Watts try one rated at 300&nbsp;Watts).</para>

	  </orderedlist>

	  <para>You should also read the SIG11 FAQ (listed below) which
	    has excellent explanations of all these problems, albeit from
	    a &linux; viewpoint.  It also discusses how memory testing

	      login.conf(5)</errorname>?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The &os; kernel will only allow a certain number of
	    processes to exist at one time.  The number is based on the
	    <varname>kern.maxusers</varname> &man.sysctl.8; variable.
	    <varname>kern.maxusers</varname> also affects various other
	    in-kernel limits, such as network buffers.
	    If your machine is heavily loaded, you probably
	    want to increase <varname>kern.maxusers</varname>.  This
	    will increase these other system limits in addition to the
	    maximum number of processes.</para>

	  <para>To adjust your <varname>kern.maxusers</varname> value,
	    see the <link xlink:href="&url.books.handbook;/configtuning-kernel-limits.html#kern-maxfiles">File/Process Limits</link>
	    section of the Handbook.  (While that section refers to open
	    files, the same limits apply to processes.)</para>

	  <para>If your machine is lightly loaded, and you are simply
	    running a very large number of processes, you can adjust
	    this with the <varname>kern.maxproc</varname> tunable.  If
	    this tunable needs adjustment it needs to be defined in
	    <filename>/boot/loader.conf</filename>.  The tunable will
	    not get adjusted until the system is rebooted.  For more
	    information about tuning tunables, see
	    &man.loader.conf.5;.
	    If these processes are being run by a single user, you will
	    also need to adjust <varname>kern.maxprocperuid</varname> to
	    be one less than your new <varname>kern.maxproc</varname>
	    value.  (It must be at least one less because one system

	  <para>Why does it take so long to connect to my computer via
	    <command>ssh</command> or <command>telnet</command>?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The symptom: there is a long delay between the time the
	    TCP connection is established and the time when the client
	    software asks for a password (or, in &man.telnet.1;'s case,
	    when a login prompt appears).</para>

	  <para>The problem: more likely than not, the delay is caused
	    by the server software trying to resolve the client's IP
	    address into a hostname.  Many servers, including the
	    <application>Telnet</application> and
	    <application>SSH</application> servers that come with &os;,
	    do this to store the hostname
	    in a log file for future reference by the
	    administrator.</para>

	  <para>The remedy: if the problem occurs whenever you connect
	    from your computer (the client) to any server, the problem is
	    with the client; likewise, if the problem only occurs when
	    someone connects to your computer (the server) the problem
	    is with the server.</para>

	  <para>If the problem is with the client, the only remedy is to
	    fix the DNS so the server can resolve it.  If this is on a
	    local network, consider it a server problem and keep
	    reading; conversely, if this is on the global Internet, you
	    will most likely need to contact your ISP and ask them to
	    fix it for you.</para>

	  <para>If the problem is with the server, and this is on a
	    local network, you need to configure the server to be able to
	    resolve address-to-hostname queries for your local address
	    range.  See the &man.hosts.5; and &man.named.8; manual pages
	    for more information.  If this is on the global Internet,
	    the problem may be that your server's resolver is not
	    functioning correctly.  To check, try to look up another
	    host &mdash; say, <systemitem>www.yahoo.com</systemitem>.  If it
	    does not work, that is your problem.</para>

	  <para>Following a fresh install of &os;, it is also possible
	    that domain and name server information is missing from
	    <filename>/etc/resolv.conf</filename>.  This will often
	    cause a delay in <application>SSH</application>, as the
	    option <literal>UseDNS</literal> is set to
	    <literal>yes</literal> by default in
	    <filename>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</filename>.
	    If this is causing the

	    <literal>UseDNS</literal> to <literal>no</literal> in

	  <para>What is a <errorname>lock order

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The &os; kernel uses a number of resource locks to
	    arbitrate contention for certain resources.  When multiple
	    kernel threads try to obtain multiple resource locks,
	    there's always the potential for a deadlock,
	    where two threads have each obtained one of the locks and
	    blocks forever waiting for the other thread to release one
	    of the other locks.  This sort of locking problem can be
	    avoided if all threads obtain the locks in the same
	    order.</para>

	  <para>A run-time lock diagnostic system called &man.witness.4;,
	    enabled in &os.current; and disabled by default for stable
	    branches and releases, detects the potential for deadlocks due to
	    locking errors, including errors caused by obtaining multiple
	    resource locks with a different order from different parts of the
	    kernel.  The &man.witness.4; framework tries to detect this
	    problem as it happens, and reports it by printing a message to the

	  <para>What does <errorname>Called ...  with the following
	      non-sleepable locks held</errorname> mean?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>This means that a function that may sleep was called
	    while a mutex (or other unsleepable) lock was held.</para>

	  <para>The reason this is an error is because mutexes are not
	    intended to be held for long periods of time; they are
	    supposed to only be held to maintain short periods of
	    synchronization.  This programming contract allows device
	    drivers to use mutexes to synchronize with the rest of the
	    kernel during interrupts.  Interrupts (under &os;) may not
	    sleep.  Hence it is imperative that no subsystem in the
	    kernel block for an extended period while holding a
	    mutex.</para>

	  <para>To catch such errors, assertions may be added to the
	    kernel that interact with the &man.witness.4; subsystem to
	    emit a warning or fatal error (depending on the system
	    configuration) when a potentially blocking call is made
	    while holding a mutex.</para>

	  <para>In summary, such warnings are non-fatal, however with
	    unfortunate timing they could cause undesirable effects
	    ranging from a minor blip in the system's responsiveness to
	    a complete system lockup.</para>

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Many people need to write shell scripts which will be
	    portable across many systems.  That is why &posix;
	    specifies the shell and utility commands in great detail.
	    Most scripts are written in Bourne shell (&man.sh.1;), and
	    because several important programming interfaces
	    (&man.make.1;, &man.system.3;, &man.popen.3;, and
	    analogues in higher-level scripting languages like Perl
	    and Tcl) are specified to use the Bourne shell to
	    interpret commands.  Because the Bourne shell is so often
	    and widely used, it is important for it to be quick to
	    start, be deterministic in its behavior, and have a small
	    memory footprint.</para>

	  <para>The existing implementation is our best effort at
	    meeting as many of these requirements simultaneously as we
	    can.  To keep <command>/bin/sh</command> small,
	    we have not provided many of the convenience features that
	    other shells have.  That is why other more
	    featureful shells like
	    <command>bash</command>, <command>scsh</command>,
	    &man.tcsh.1;, and <command>zsh</command> are available.
	    (You can
	    compare for yourself the memory utilization of all these

	  <para><literal>GENERIC</literal> kernels shipped with &os;

	    Kernels built in debug mode
	    contain many symbols in separate files that are used for

	    around in case of a system panic.</para>

	  <para>However, if you are running low on disk space, there

	  <para>Replace <emphasis>accf_httpd ipfw</emphasis> with
	    a list of modules you need.  Only these modules will be

	    &man.boot0cfg.8;, so that you can dual boot to the old or
	    new system after the copying is done.</para>

	  <para>Now you have the new disk set up, and are ready to move
	    the data.  Unfortunately, you cannot just blindly copy the
	    data.  Things like device files (in
	    <filename>/dev</filename>), flags, and links tend to screw
	    that up.  You need to use tools that understand these
	    things, which means &man.dump.8;.  Although it is suggested
	    that you move the data in single user mode, it is not
	    required.</para>

	  <para>You should never use anything but &man.dump.8; and
	    &man.restore.8; to move the root file system.  The
	    &man.tar.1; command may work &mdash; then again, it may not.
	    You should also use &man.dump.8; and &man.restore.8; if you
	    are moving a single partition to another empty partition.
	    The sequence of steps to use <command>dump</command> to move
	    a partitions data to a new partition is:</para>

	  <procedure>
	    <step>
	      <para><command>newfs</command> the new partition.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para><command>mount</command> it on a temporary mount
		point.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para><command>cd</command> to that directory.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para><command>dump</command> the old partition, piping
		output to the new one.</para>
	    </step>
	  </procedure>

	  <para>For example, if you are going to move root to
	    <filename>/dev/ada1s1a</filename>,
	    with <filename>/mnt</filename> as
	    the temporary mount point, it is:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs /dev/ada1s1a</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/ada1s1a /mnt</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /mnt</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>dump 0af - / | restore rf -</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Rearranging your partitions with <command>dump</command>
	    takes a bit more work.  To merge a partition like
	    <filename>/var</filename> into its parent, create the new
	    partition large enough for both, move the parent partition
	    as described above, then move the child partition into the
	    empty directory that the first move created:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs /dev/ada1s1a</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/ada1s1a /mnt</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /mnt</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>dump 0af - / | restore rf -</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd var</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>dump 0af - /var | restore rf -</userinput></screen>

	  <para>To split a directory from its parent, say putting
	    <filename>/var</filename> on its own partition when it was
	    not before, create both partitions, then mount the child
	    partition on the appropriate directory in the temporary
	    mount point, then move the old single partition:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs /dev/ada1s1a</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>newfs /dev/ada1s1d</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/ada1s1a /mnt</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mkdir /mnt/var</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>mount /dev/ada1s1d /mnt/var</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /mnt</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>dump 0af - / | restore rf -</userinput></screen>

	  <para>You might prefer &man.cpio.1;, &man.pax.1;, &man.tar.1;
	    to &man.dump.8; for user data.  At the time of this writing,
	    these are known to lose file flag information, so use them

	<question xml:id="safe-softupdates">
	  <para>Which partitions can safely use Soft Updates?  I have
	    heard that Soft Updates on <filename>/</filename> can cause
	    problems.  What about Journaled Soft Updates?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Short answer: you can usually use Soft Updates safely on
	    all partitions.</para>

	  <para>Long answer:  Soft Updates has two
	    characteristics that may be undesirable on certain
	    paritions.  First, a Soft Updates
	    partition has a small chance of losing data during a system
	    crash.  (The partition will not be corrupted; the data will
	    simply be lost.)  Second, Soft Updates can cause temporary
	    space shortages.</para>

	  <para>When using Soft Updates, the kernel can take up to
	    thirty seconds to write changes to the physical
	    disk.  When a large file is deleted the file still
	    resides on
	    disk until the kernel actually performs the deletion.  This
	    can cause a very simple race condition.  Suppose you delete
	    one large file and immediately create another large file.
	    The first large file is not yet actually removed from the
	    physical disk, so the disk might not have enough room for
	    the second large file.  You get an error that the partition
	    does not have enough space, although you know perfectly well
	    that you just released a large chunk of space!  When you try
	    again mere seconds later, the file creation works as you
	    expect.  This has left more than one user scratching his
	    head and doubting his sanity, the &os; file system, or
	    both.</para>

	  <para>If a system should crash after the kernel accepts a
	    chunk of data for writing to disk, but before that data is
	    actually written out, data could be lost.  This
	    risk is extremely small, but generally manageable.</para>

	  <para>These issues affect all partitions using Soft Updates.
	    So, what does this mean for the root partition?</para>

	  <para>Vital information on the root partition changes very
	    rarely.  If the
	    system crashed during the thirty-second window after such a
	    change is made, it is possible that data could be lost.
	    This risk is negligible for most applications, but you
	    should be aware that it exists.  If your system cannot
	    tolerate this much risk, do not use Soft Updates on the root
	    file system!</para>

	  <para><filename>/</filename> is traditionally one of the
	    smallest partitions.  If you put the
	    <filename>/tmp</filename> directory on
	    <filename>/</filename> and you have a busy
	    <filename>/tmp</filename>, you might see intermittent space
	    problems.  Symlinking <filename>/tmp</filename> to
	    <filename>/var/tmp</filename> will solve this
	    problem.</para>

	  <para>Finally, &man.dump.8; does not work in live mode (-L)
	    on a filesystem, with Journaled Soft Updates
	    (<acronym>SU+J</acronym>).</para>

	<question xml:id="nt-bootloader">
	  <para>How can I use the &windowsnt; loader to boot
	    &os;?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The general idea is that you copy the first sector of
	    your native root &os; partition into a file in the
	    DOS/&windowsnt; partition.  Assuming you name that file
	    something like <filename>c:\bootsect.bsd</filename>
	    (inspired by <filename>c:\bootsect.dos</filename>), you can
	    then edit <filename>c:\boot.ini</filename> to come
	    up with something like this:</para>

	  <programlisting>[boot loader]
timeout=30
default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS
[operating systems]
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS="Windows NT"
C:\BOOTSECT.BSD="&os;"
C:\="DOS"</programlisting>

	  <para>If &os; is installed on the same disk as the &windowsnt;
	    boot partition simply copy <filename>/boot/boot1</filename> to
	    <filename>C:\BOOTSECT.BSD</filename>.  However, if &os; is
	    installed on a different disk
	    <filename>/boot/boot1</filename> will not work,
	    <filename>/boot/boot0</filename> is needed.</para>

	  <para><filename>/boot/boot0</filename> needs to be installed
	    using &man.sysinstall.8; by selecting the &os; boot manager
	    on the screen which asks if you wish to use a boot manager.
	    This is because <filename>/boot/boot0</filename> has the
	    partition table area filled with NULL characters but
	    &man.sysinstall.8; copies the partition table before copying
	    <filename>/boot/boot0</filename> to the MBR.</para>

	  <warning>
	    <para><emphasis>Do not simply copy
		<filename>/boot/boot0</filename> instead of
		<filename>/boot/boot1</filename>; you will overwrite
		your partition table and render your computer
		un-bootable!</emphasis></para>
	  </warning>

	  <para>When the &os; boot manager runs it records the last OS
	    booted by setting the active flag on the partition table
	    entry for that OS and then writes the whole 512-bytes of
	    itself back to the MBR so if you just copy
	    <filename>/boot/boot0</filename> to
	    <filename>C:\BOOTSECT.BSD</filename> then it writes an empty
	    partition table, with the active flag set on one entry, to
	    the MBR.</para>

	  <para>If you have &os; and &linux; on the same disk, just

	    are:</para>

	  <para>Boot &linux;, and add the following lines to

	  <programlisting>other=/dev/hda2

	  <para>(the above assumes that your &os; slice is known to

	    suit your setup).  Then, run <command>lilo</command> as
	    <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> and you should be done.</para>

	  <para>If &os; resides on another disk, you need to add
	    <literal>loader=/boot/chain.b</literal> to the LILO entry.
	    For example:</para>

	  <programlisting>other=/dev/dab4
        table=/dev/dab
        loader=/boot/chain.b
        label=&os;</programlisting>

	  <para>In some cases you may need to specify the BIOS drive
	    number to the &os; boot loader to successfully boot off the
	    second disk.  For example, if your &os; SCSI disk is probed
	    by BIOS as BIOS disk 1, at the &os; boot loader prompt you

	  <para>How do I let ordinary users mount CD-ROMs, DVDs,
	    USB drives, and other removable media?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>As <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> set the sysctl variable
	    <varname>vfs.usermount</varname> to
	    <literal>1</literal>.</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl vfs.usermount=1</userinput></screen>

	  <para>To make this persist across reboots, add the line
	    <literal>vfs.usermount=1</literal> to
	    <filename>/etc/sysctl.conf</filename> so that
	    it is reset at system boot time.</para>

	  <para>Users can only mount devices they have read
	    permissions to.  To allow users to mount a device
	    permissions must be set in
	    <filename>/etc/devfs.conf</filename>.</para>

	  <para>For example, to allow users to mount the first USB
	    drive add:</para>

	  <programlisting># Allow all users to mount a USB drive.
	    own       /dev/da0       root:operator
	    perm      /dev/da00       0666</programlisting>

	  <para>All users can now mount devices they could read
	    onto a directory that they own:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>mkdir ~/my-mount-point</userinput>
&prompt.user; <userinput>mount -t msdosfs /dev/da0~/my-mount-point</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Unmounting the device is simple:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>umount ~/my-mount-point</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Enabling <varname>vfs.usermount</varname>, however, has
	    negative security implications.  A better way to access
	    &ms-dos; formatted media is to use the <package>emulators/mtools</package> package in the

	<question xml:id="du-vs-df">
	  <para>The <command>du</command> and <command>df</command>
	    commands show different amounts of disk space available.
	    What is going on?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>You need to understand what <command>du</command> and
	    <command>df</command> really do.  <command>du</command> goes
	    through the directory tree, measures how large each file is,
	    and presents the totals.  <command>df</command> just asks
	    the file system how much space it has left.  They seem to be
	    the same thing, but a file without a directory entry will
	    affect <command>df</command> but not
	    <command>du</command>.</para>

	  <para>When a program is using a file, and you delete the file,
	    the file is not really removed from the file system until
	    the program stops using it.  The file is immediately deleted
	    from the directory listing, however.  You can see this
	    easily enough with a program such as
	    <command>more</command>.  Assume you have a file large
	    enough that its presence affects the output of
	    <command>du</command> and <command>df</command>.  (Since
	    disks can be so large today, this might be a
	    <emphasis>very</emphasis> large file!) If you delete this
	    file while using <command>more</command> on it,
	    <command>more</command> does not immediately choke and
	    complain that it cannot view the file.  The entry is simply
	    removed from the directory so no other program or user can
	    access it.  <command>du</command> shows that it is gone
	    &mdash; it has walked the directory tree and the file is not
	    listed.  <command>df</command> shows that it is still there,
	    as the file system knows that <command>more</command> is
	    still using that space.  Once you end the
	    <command>more</command> session, <command>du</command> and
	    <command>df</command> will agree.</para>

	  <para>This situation is common on web servers.  Many people
	    set up a &os; web server and forget to rotate the log files.
	    The access log fills up <filename>/var</filename>.  The new
	    administrator deletes the file, but the system still
	    complains that the partition is full.  Stopping and
	    restarting the web server program would free the file,
	    allowing the system to release the disk space.  To prevent
	    this from happening, set up &man.newsyslog.8;.</para>

	  <para>Note that Soft Updates can delay the freeing of disk
	    space; you might need to wait up to 30 seconds for the
	    change to be visible!</para>

	  <question xml:id="what-is-zil">
	    <para>What is the ZIL and when does it get used?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>The <acronym>ZIL</acronym> ((<acronym>ZFS</acronym>
	      intent log) is a write log used to implement posix write
	      commitment semantics across crashes.  Normally writes
	      are bundled up into transaction groups
	      and written to disk when filled (<quote>Transaction Group
		Commit</quote>).  However syscalls like &man.fsync.2;
	      require a commitment that the data is written to stable
	      storage before returning.
	      The ZIL is needed for writes that have been acknowledged
	      as written but which are not yet on disk as part of a
	      transaction.  The transaction groups are timestamped.
	      In the event of a crash the last valid timestamp is
	      found and missing data is merged in from the ZIL.</para>

	  <answer>
	    <para>By default, ZFS stores the ZIL in the pool with all
	      the data.  If your application has a heavy write load,
	      storing the ZIL in a separate device that has very fast
	      synchronous, sequential write performance can improve
	      overall system.  For other workloads, a SSD is unlikely
	      to make much of an improvement.</para>

	  <answer>
	    <para>The <acronym>L2ARC</acronym> is a read cache stored
	      on a fast device such as an <acronym>SSD</acronym>.
	      This cache is not persisent across
	      reboots.  Note that RAM is used as the first layer
	      of cache and the L2ARC is only needed if there is
	      insufficient RAM.</para>

	    <para>L2ARC needs space in the ARC to index it.  So,
	      perversely, a working set that fits perfectly in the
	      ARC will not fit perfectly any more if a L2ARC is used
	      because part of the ARC is holding the L2ARC index,
	      pushing part of the working set into the
	      L2ARC which is slower than RAM.</para>

	  <question xml:id="should-enable-dedup">
	    <para>Is enabling deduplication advisable?</para>
	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>Generally speaking, no.</para>

	    <para>Deduplication takes up a significant amount
	      of RAM and may slow down read and write
	      disk access times.  Unless one is storing data that is
	      very heavily duplicated (such as virtual machine images,
	      or user backups) it is possible that deduplication will
	      do more harm than good.  Another consideration is the
	      inability to revert deduplication status.  If data is
	      written when deduplication is enabled, disabling dedup
	      will not cause those blocks which were deduplicated to
	      be replicated until they are next modified.</para>

	    <para>Deduplication can also lead to some unexpected
	      situations.  In particular deleting files may become much

	  </question>

	  <answer>
	    <para>This could happen because the pool is 100% full.
	      ZFS requires space on the disk to write
	      transaction metadata.  To restore the pool
	      to a usable state, truncate a file you want to
	      delete.</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>truncate -s 0 unimportant-file</userinput></screen>

	  <para>The primary configuration file is

	    Instead, if there is any entry in
	    <filename>/etc/defaults/rc.conf</filename> that you want to

	  <para>Why do I keep getting messages like <errorname>root: not
	      found</errorname> after editing
	    <filename>/etc/crontab</filename></para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>This is normally caused by editing the system crontab
	    (<filename>/etc/crontab</filename>) and then using
	    &man.crontab.1; to install it:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>crontab /etc/crontab</userinput></screen>

	  <para>This is not the correct way to do things.  The system
	    crontab has a different format to the per-user crontabs
	    which &man.crontab.1; updates (the &man.crontab.5; manual
	    page explains the differences in more detail).</para>

	  <para>If this is what you did, the extra crontab is simply a
	    copy of <filename>/etc/crontab</filename> in the wrong
	    format it.  Delete it with the command:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>crontab -r</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Next time, when you edit
	    <filename>/etc/crontab</filename>, you should not do
	    anything to inform &man.cron.8; of the changes, since it
	    will notice them automatically.</para>

	  <para>If you want something to be run once per day, week, or
	    month, it is probably better to add shell scripts
	    <filename>/usr/local/etc/periodic</filename>, and let the
	    &man.periodic.8; command run from the system
	    <command>cron</command> schedule it with the other periodic
	    system tasks.</para>

	  <para>The actual reason for the error is that the system
	    crontab has an extra field, specifying which user to run the
	    command as.  In the default system crontab provided with
	    &os;, this is <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> for all entries.
	    When this crontab is used as the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>
	    user's crontab (which is <emphasis>not</emphasis> the same
	    as the system crontab), &man.cron.8; assumes the string
	    <literal>root</literal> is the first word of the command to

	<answer>
	  <para>Yes, &os; supports System V-style IPC, including shared
	    memory, messages and semaphores, in the
	    <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel.  With a custom kernel,
	    support may be loaded with the <filename>sysvshm.ko</filename>,
	    <filename>sysvsem.ko</filename> and <filename>
	      sysvmsg.ko</filename> kernel modules, or
	    enabled in the custom kernel by adding the following lines to your
	    kernel config:</para>

	  <programlisting>options    SYSVSHM          # enable shared memory

	  <note>
	    <para>If you are still prompted to give the

	      <guimenuitem>Shell</guimenuitem> at the beginning of the install
	      process and issue the commands mentioned above.  You will need to
	      mount the specific partition in this case and then chroot to it,

	<question xml:id="release-candidate">
	  <para>I tried to update my system to the latest
	    <emphasis>-STABLE</emphasis>, but got
	    <emphasis>-BETA<replaceable>x</replaceable></emphasis>,
	    <emphasis>-RC</emphasis> or
	    <emphasis>-PRERELEASE</emphasis>!  What is going on?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Short answer: it is just a name.
	    <emphasis>RC</emphasis> stands for <quote>Release
	      Candidate</quote>.  It signifies that a release is imminent.
	    In &os;, <emphasis>-PRERELEASE</emphasis> is typically
	    synonymous with the code freeze before a release.  (For some
	    releases, the <emphasis>-BETA</emphasis> label was used in
	    the same way as <emphasis>-PRERELEASE</emphasis>.)</para>

	  <para>Long answer: &os; derives its releases from one of two
	    places.  Major, dot-zero, releases, such as 9.0-RELEASE
	    are branched from the head of the development
	    stream, commonly referred to as <link linkend="current">-CURRENT</link>.  Minor releases, such as
	    6.3-RELEASE or 5.2-RELEASE, have been snapshots of the
	    active <link linkend="stable">-STABLE</link> branch.
	    Starting with 4.3-RELEASE, each release also now has its own
	    branch which can be tracked by people requiring an extremely
	    conservative rate of development (typically only security
	    advisories).</para>

	  <para>When a release is about to be made, the branch from
	    which it will be derived from has to undergo a certain
	    process.  Part of this process is a code freeze.  When a
	    code freeze is initiated, the name of the branch is changed
	    to reflect that it is about to become a release.  For
	    example, if the branch used to be called 6.2-STABLE, its
	    name will be changed to 6.3-PRERELEASE to signify the code
	    freeze and signify that extra pre-release testing should be
	    happening.  Bug fixes can still be committed to be part of
	    the release.  When the source code is in shape for the
	    release the name will be changed to 6.3-RC to signify that a
	    release is about to be made from it.  Once in the RC stage,
	    only the most critical bugs found can be fixed.  Once the
	    release (6.3-RELEASE in this example) and release branch
	    have been made, the branch will be renamed to
	    6.3-STABLE.</para>

	    Subversion branches, refer to the <link xlink:href="&url.articles.releng;/article.html">Release Engineering</link>

	<answer>

	  <para>Pages are most often written to disk (sort of a VM sync)

	    there can be an advantage for a block of VM pages to be

	<answer>
	  <para>Your system is probably running at a raised

	<question xml:id="x-and-moused">
	  <para>Why does my mouse not work with X?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>If you are using &man.syscons.4; (the default console
	    driver), you can configure &os; to support a mouse pointer on
	    each virtual screen.  To avoid conflicting with X,
	    &man.syscons.4; supports a virtual device called
	    <filename>/dev/sysmouse</filename>.  All mouse events
	    received from the real mouse device are written to the
	    &man.sysmouse.4; device via &man.moused.8;.  To use your
	    mouse on one or more virtual consoles,
	    <emphasis>and</emphasis> use X, see <xref linkend="moused" remap="another section"/> and set up
	    &man.moused.8;.</para>

	  <para>Then edit <filename>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</filename> and
	    make sure you have the following lines:</para>

	  <programlisting>Section "InputDevice"
   Option          "Protocol" "SysMouse"
   Option          "Device" "/dev/sysmouse"
.....</programlisting>

	  <para>Starting with &xorg; version 7.4, the
	    <literal>InputDevice</literal> sections in
	    <filename>xorg.conf</filename> are ignored in favor of
	    autodetected devices.  To restore the old behavior, add the
	    following line to the <literal>ServerLayout</literal> or
	    <literal>ServerFlags</literal> section:</para>

	  <programlisting>Option "AutoAddDevices" "false"</programlisting>

	  <para>Some people prefer to use
	    <filename>/dev/mouse</filename> under X.  To make this
	    work, <filename>/dev/mouse</filename> should be linked
	    to <filename>/dev/sysmouse</filename> (see

	<question xml:id="virtual-console">
	  <para>What is a virtual console and how do I make more?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Virtual consoles, put simply, enable you to have several
	    simultaneous sessions on the same machine without doing
	    anything complicated like setting up a network or running
	    X.</para>

	  <para>When the system starts, it will display a login prompt
	    on the monitor after displaying all the boot messages.  You
	    can then type in your login name and password and start
	    working (or playing!) on the first virtual console.</para>

	  <para>At some point, you will probably wish to start another
	    session, perhaps to look at documentation for a program you
	    are running or to read your mail while waiting for an FTP
	    transfer to finish.  Just do <keycombo action="simul"><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo>
	    (hold down <keycap>Alt</keycap> and press
	    <keycap>F2</keycap>), and you will find a login prompt
	    waiting for you on the second <quote>virtual
	      console</quote>!  When you want to go back to the original
	    session, do <keycombo action="simul"><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo>.</para>

	  <para>The default &os; installation has eight virtual consoles
	    enabled.  <keycombo action="simul"><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo>,
	    <keycombo action="simul"><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F2</keycap></keycombo>,
	    <keycombo action="simul"><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F3</keycap></keycombo>,
	    and so on will switch between these virtual consoles.</para>

	  <para>To enable more of them, edit
	    <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> (see &man.ttys.5;) and add
	    entries for <filename>ttyv8</filename> to
	    <filename>ttyvc</filename> after the comment on
	    <quote>Virtual terminals</quote>:</para>

	  <programlisting># Edit the existing entry for ttyv8 in /etc/ttys and change
# "off" to "on".
ttyv8   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         xterm  on secure
ttyv9   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         xterm  on secure
ttyva   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         xterm  on secure
ttyvb   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         xterm  on secure</programlisting>

	  <para>Use as many or as few as you want.  The more virtual
	    terminals you have, the more resources that are used; this
	    can be important if you have 8&nbsp;MB RAM or less.  You may
	    also want to change the <literal>secure</literal> to
	    <literal>insecure</literal>.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>Versions of &os; prior to 9.0 used the <quote>
		cons25</quote> terminal type, and not <quote>
		xterm</quote>.  Existing entries in
	      <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> can be used on which to
	      base new additions.</para>
	  </note>

	  <important>
	    <para>If you want to run an X server you
	      <emphasis>must</emphasis> leave at least one virtual
	      terminal unused (or turned off) for it to use.  That is to
	      say that if you want to have a login prompt pop up for all
	      twelve of your Alt-function keys, you are out of luck
	      &mdash; you can only do this for eleven of them if you
	      also want to run an X server on the same machine.</para>
	  </important>

	  <para>The easiest way to disable a console is by turning it
	    off.  For example, if you had the full 12 terminal
	    allocation mentioned above and you wanted to run X, you
	    would change settings for virtual terminal 12 from:</para>

	  <programlisting>ttyvb   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         xterm  on  secure</programlisting>

	  <para>to:</para>

	  <programlisting>ttyvb   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         xterm  off secure</programlisting>

	  <para>If your keyboard has only ten function keys, you would
	    end up with:</para>

	  <programlisting>ttyv9   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         xterm  off secure
ttyva   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         xterm  off secure
ttyvb   "/usr/libexec/getty Pc"         xterm  off secure</programlisting>

	  <para>(You could also just delete these lines.)</para>

	  <para>Next, the easiest (and cleanest) way to activate the
	    virtual consoles is to reboot.  However, if you really do
	    not want to reboot, you can just shut down the X Window
	    system and execute (as <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>):</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>kill -HUP 1</userinput></screen>

	  <para>It is imperative that you completely shut down X Window
	    if it is running, before running this command.  If you do not,
	    your system will probably appear to hang or lock up after
	    executing <command>kill</command>.</para>

	    to switch back to a virtual console.  <keycombo action="simul"><keycap>Ctrl</keycap><keycap>Alt</keycap><keycap>F1</keycap></keycombo>

	  <para>To return to the X session, you must switch to the

	<question xml:id="xdm-boot">
	  <para>How do I start <application>XDM</application> on
	    boot?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>There are two schools of thought on how to start
	    &man.xdm.1;.  One school starts <command>xdm</command> from
	    <filename>/etc/ttys</filename> (see &man.ttys.5;) using the
	    supplied example, while the other simply runs
	    <command>xdm</command> from
	    <filename>rc.local</filename> (see &man.rc.8;) or from an
	    <filename>X</filename> script in
	    <filename>/usr/local/etc/rc.d</filename>.  Both are equally
	    valid, and one may work in situations where the other does
	    not.  In both cases the result is the same: X will pop up a
	    graphical login prompt.</para>

	  <para>The &man.ttys.5; method has the advantage of documenting
	    which vty X will start on and passing the responsibility of
	    restarting the X server on logout to &man.init.8;.  The
	    &man.rc.8; method makes it easy to <command>kill</command>
	    <command>xdm</command> if there is a problem starting the X
	    server.</para>

	  <para>If loaded from &man.rc.8;, <command>xdm</command> should
	    be started without any arguments (i.e., as a daemon).
	    <command>xdm</command> must start
	    <emphasis>after</emphasis> &man.getty.8; runs, or else
	    <command>getty</command> and <command>xdm</command> will
	    conflict, locking out the console.  The best way around this
	    is to have the script sleep 10 seconds or so then launch
	    <command>xdm</command>.</para>

	  <para>If you are to start <command>xdm</command> from
	    <filename>/etc/ttys</filename>, there still is a chance of
	    conflict between <command>xdm</command> and &man.getty.8;.
	    One way to avoid this is to add the <literal>vt</literal>
	    number in
	    <filename>/usr/local/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers</filename></para>

	  <programlisting>:0 local /usr/local/bin/X vt4</programlisting>

	  <para>The above example will direct the X server to run in
	    <filename>/dev/ttyv3</filename>.  Note the number is
	    offset by one.  The X server counts the vty from one,
	    whereas the &os; kernel numbers the vty from zero.</para>

	  <para>Why is my <command>ipfw</command> <quote>fwd</quote>
	    rule to redirect a service to another machine not
	    working?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Possibly because you want to do network address
	    translation (NAT) and not just forward packets.  A
	    <quote>fwd</quote> rule does exactly what it says; it
	    forwards packets.  It does not actually change the data
	    inside the packet.  Say we have a rule like:</para>

	  <screen>01000 fwd <replaceable>10.0.0.1</replaceable> from any to <replaceable>foo 21</replaceable></screen>

	  <para>When a packet with a destination address of
	    <replaceable>foo</replaceable> arrives at the machine with
	    this rule, the packet is forwarded to
	    <replaceable>10.0.0.1</replaceable>, but it still has the
	    destination address of <replaceable>foo</replaceable>!  The
	    destination address of the packet is
	    <emphasis>not</emphasis> changed to
	    <replaceable>10.0.0.1</replaceable>.  Most machines would
	    probably drop a packet that they receive with a destination
	    address that is not their own.  Therefore, using a
	    <quote>fwd</quote> rule does not often work the way the user

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>This is the kernel telling you that some activity is
	    provoking it to send more ICMP or TCP reset (RST) responses
	    than it thinks it should.  ICMP responses are often
	    generated as a result of attempted connections to unused UDP
	    ports.  TCP resets are generated as a result of attempted
	    connections to unopened TCP ports.  Among others, these are
	    the kinds of activities which may cause these
	    messages:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>Brute-force denial of service (DoS) attacks (as
		opposed to single-packet attacks which exploit a
		specific vulnerability).</para>

		number of ports (as opposed to only trying a few
		well-known ports).</para>
	    </listitem>
	  </itemizedlist>

	  <para>The first number in the message tells you how many
	    packets the kernel would have sent if the limit was not in
	    place, and the second number tells you the limit.  You can
	    control the limit using the
	    <varname>net.inet.icmp.icmplim</varname> sysctl variable
	    like this, where <literal>300</literal> is the limit in
	    packets per second:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl net.inet.icmp.icmplim=300</userinput></screen>

	  <para>If you do not want to see messages about this in your
	    log files, but you still want the kernel to do response
	    limiting, you can use the
	    <varname>net.inet.icmp.icmplim_output</varname> sysctl
	    variable to disable the output like this:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>sysctl net.inet.icmp.icmplim_output=0</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Finally, if you want to disable response limiting, you
	    can set the <varname>net.inet.icmp.icmplim</varname> sysctl
	    variable (see above for an example) to <literal>0</literal>.

	      <para>The process is said to be able to
		<quote>play</quote> inside the walls.  That is, nothing
		the process does in regards to executing code is
		supposed to be able to breech the walls so you do not
		have to do a detailed audit of its code to be able to
		say certain things about its security.</para>

	      <para>The walls might be a user&nbsp;ID, for example.
		This is the definition used in the &man.security.7; and
		&man.named.8; man pages.</para>

	      <para>Take the <literal>ntalk</literal> service, for

	      <para>The most common way to accomplish this is to build a

		is able to write to those files, but only the process
		sees the effects &mdash; other processes in the system
		do not, necessarily.</para>

	    least some of the securelevel's protections are
	    enabled.</para>

	  <para>The securelevel of a running system can not be
	    lowered as this would defeat its purpose.  If you need
	    to do a task that requires that the securelevel be
	    non-positive (e.g., an <buildtarget>installworld</buildtarget>
	    or changing the date), you will have to change the
	    securelevel setting in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>
	    (you want to look for the
	    <varname>kern_securelevel</varname> and
	    <varname>kern_securelevel_enable</varname> variables) and
	    reboot.</para>

	  <para>For more information on securelevel and the specific
	    things all the levels do, please consult the &man.init.8;
	    manual page.</para>

	  <warning>
	    <para>Securelevel is not a silver bullet; it has many known
	      deficiencies.  More often than not, it provides a false
	      sense of security.</para>

	    <para>One of its biggest problems is that in order for it to
	      be at all effective, all files used in the boot process up
	      until the securelevel is set must be protected.  If an
	      attacker can get the system to execute their code prior to
	      the securelevel being set (which happens quite late in the
	      boot process since some things the system must do at
	      start-up cannot be done at an elevated securelevel), its
	      protections are invalidated.  While this task of
	      protecting all files used in the boot process is not
	      technically impossible, if it is achieved, system
	      maintenance will become a nightmare since one would have
	      to take the system down, at least to single-user mode, to
	      modify a configuration file.</para>

	<answer>
	  <para>BIND uses a random high-numbered port for outgoing

	<answer>
	  <para>Do not worry.  <systemitem class="username">toor</systemitem> is an
	    <quote>alternative</quote> superuser account (toor is root
	    spelt backwards).  Previously it was created when the

	    shell so you do not have to change
	    <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>'s default shell.  This is
	    important as shells which are not part of the base
	    distribution (for example a shell installed from ports or
	    packages) are likely to be installed in
	    <filename>/usr/local/bin</filename> which, by default,
	    resides on a different file system.  If
	    <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>'s shell is located in
	    <filename>/usr/local/bin</filename> and
	    <filename>/usr</filename> (or whatever file system contains
	    <filename>/usr/local/bin</filename>) is not mounted for some
	    reason, <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> will not be able to log in
	    to fix a problem (although if you reboot into single user
	    mode you will be prompted for the path to a shell).</para>

	  <para>Some people use <systemitem class="username">toor</systemitem> for day-to-day
	    <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> tasks with a non-standard shell,
	    leaving <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>, with a standard shell,
	    for single user mode or emergencies.  By default you cannot

	  <para>Many people experience hung connections with no apparent
	    explanation.  The first thing to establish is which side of
	    the link is hung.</para>

	  <para>If you are using an external modem, you can simply try
	    using &man.ping.8; to see if the <acronym>TD</acronym> light
	    is flashing when you transmit data.  If it flashes (and the
	    <acronym>RD</acronym> light does not), the problem is with
	    the remote end.  If <acronym>TD</acronym> does not flash,
	    the problem is local.  With an internal modem, you will need
	    to use the <literal>set server</literal> command in
	    <filename>ppp.conf</filename>.  When the hang occurs,
	    connect to &man.ppp.8; using &man.pppctl.8;.  If your
	    network connection suddenly revives (PPP was revived due to
	    the activity on the diagnostic socket) or if you cannot
	    connect (assuming the <literal>set socket</literal> command
	    succeeded at startup time), the problem is local.  If you
	    can connect and things are still hung, enable local async
	    logging with <literal>set log local async</literal> and use
	    &man.ping.8; from another window or terminal to make use of
	    the link.  The async logging will show you the data being
	    transmitted and received on the link.  If data is going out
	    and not coming back, the problem is remote.</para>

	  <para>Having established whether the problem is local or
	    remote, you now have two possibilities:</para>

	  <itemizedlist>
	    <listitem>
	      <para>If the problem is remote, read on entry <xref linkend="ppp-remote-not-responding"/>.</para>

	    relatively slow and therefore not that useful.  You may want
	    to avoid telling your ISP that you are running
	    user-PPP.</para>

	  <para>First, try disabling all local compression by adding the
	    following to your configuration:</para>

	  <programlisting>disable pred1 deflate deflate24 protocomp acfcomp shortseq vj
deny pred1 deflate deflate24 protocomp acfcomp shortseq vj</programlisting>

	  <para>Then reconnect to ensure that this makes no difference.
	    If things improve or if the problem is solved completely,
	    determine which setting makes the difference through trial
	    and error.  This will provide good ammunition when you
	    contact your ISP (although it may make it apparent that you
	    are not running a &microsoft; product).</para>

	  <para>Before contacting your ISP, enable async logging locally
	    and wait until the connection hangs again.  This may use up
	    quite a bit of disk space.  The last data read from the port
	    may be of interest.  It is usually ASCII data, and may even
	    describe the problem (<errorname>Memory fault</errorname>,
	    <errorname>Core dumped</errorname>).</para>

	  <para>If your ISP is helpful, they should be able to enable

	<question xml:id="ppp-same-magic">
	  <para>I keep seeing errors about magic being the same.  What

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Occasionally, just after connecting, you may see
	    messages in the log that say <errorname>Magic is
	      same</errorname>.  Sometimes, these messages are harmless,
	    and sometimes one side or the other exits.  Most PPP
	    implementations cannot survive this problem, and even if the
	    link seems to come up, you will see repeated configure
	    requests and configure acknowledgments in the log file until
	    &man.ppp.8; eventually gives up and closes the
	    connection.</para>

	  <para>This normally happens on server machines with slow disks
	    that are spawning a &man.getty.8; on the port, and executing
	    &man.ppp.8; from a login script or program after login.
	    There were reports of it happening consistently when using
	    slirp.  The reason is that in the time taken between
	    &man.getty.8; exiting and &man.ppp.8; starting, the
	    client-side &man.ppp.8; starts sending Line Control Protocol
	    (LCP) packets.  Because ECHO is still switched on for the
	    port on the server, the client &man.ppp.8; sees these
	    packets <quote>reflect</quote> back.</para>

	  <para>One part of the LCP negotiation is to establish a magic
	    number for each side of the link so that
	    <quote>reflections</quote> can be detected.  The protocol
	    says that when the peer tries to negotiate the same magic
	    number, a NAK should be sent and a new magic number should
	    be chosen.  During the period that the server port has ECHO
	    turned on, the client &man.ppp.8; sends LCP packets, sees
	    the same magic in the reflected packet and NAKs it.  It also
	    sees the NAK reflect (which also means &man.ppp.8; must
	    change its magic).  This produces a potentially enormous
	    number of magic number changes, all of which are happily
	    piling into the server's tty buffer.  As soon as &man.ppp.8;
	    starts on the server, it is flooded with magic number
	    changes and almost immediately decides it has tried enough
	    to negotiate LCP and gives up.  Meanwhile, the client, who
	    no longer sees the reflections, becomes happy just in time
	    to see a hangup from the server.</para>

	  <para>This can be avoided by allowing the peer to start
	    negotiating with the following line in
	    <filename>ppp.conf</filename>:</para>

	  <programlisting>set openmode passive</programlisting>

	  <para>This tells &man.ppp.8; to wait for the server to
	    initiate LCP negotiations.  Some servers however may never
	    initiate negotiations.  If this is the case, you can do
	    something like:</para>

	  <programlisting>set openmode active 3</programlisting>

	  <para>This tells &man.ppp.8; to be passive for 3 seconds, and
	    then to start sending LCP requests.  If the peer starts
	    sending requests during this period, &man.ppp.8; will
	    immediately respond rather than waiting for the full 3
	    second period.</para>

	<question xml:id="ppp-lcp-constant">
	  <para>LCP negotiations continue until the connection is

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>There is currently an implementation mis-feature in
	    &man.ppp.8; where it does not associate LCP, CCP &amp; IPCP
	    responses with their original requests.  As a result, if one
	    PPP implementation is more than 6 seconds slower than the
	    other side, the other side will send two additional LCP
	    configuration requests.  This is fatal.</para>

	  <para>Consider two implementations, <systemitem>A</systemitem> and
	    <systemitem>B</systemitem>.  <systemitem>A</systemitem> starts sending LCP
	    requests immediately after connecting and <systemitem>B</systemitem>
	    takes 7 seconds to start.  When <systemitem>B</systemitem> starts,
	    <systemitem>A</systemitem> has sent 3 LCP REQs.  We are assuming the
	    line has ECHO switched off, otherwise we would see magic
	    number problems as described in the previous section.
	    <systemitem>B</systemitem> sends a REQ, then an ACK to the first of
	    <systemitem>A</systemitem>'s REQs.  This results in

	<answer>
	  <para>If &man.ppp.8; is dialing unexpectedly, you must
	    determine the cause, and set up Dial filters (dfilters) to
	    prevent such dialing.</para>

	  <para>To determine the cause, use the following line:</para>

	  <programlisting>set log +tcp/ip</programlisting>

	  <para>This will log all traffic through the connection.  The
	    next time the line comes up unexpectedly, you will see the
	    reason logged with a convenient timestamp next to it.</para>

	  <para>You can now disable dialing under these circumstances.
	    Usually, this sort of problem arises due to DNS lookups.  To
	    prevent DNS lookups from establishing a connection (this
	    will <emphasis>not</emphasis> prevent &man.ppp.8; from
	    passing the packets through an established connection), use
	    the following:</para>

	  <programlisting>set dfilter 1 deny udp src eq 53

set dfilter 3 permit 0/0 0/0</programlisting>

	  <para>This is not always suitable, as it will effectively
	    break your demand-dial capabilities &mdash; most programs
	    will need a DNS lookup before doing any other network
	    related things.</para>

	  <para>In the DNS case, you should try to determine what is
	    actually trying to resolve a host name.  A lot of the time,
	    &man.sendmail.8; is the culprit.  You should make sure that
	    you tell <application>sendmail</application> not to do any
	    DNS lookups in its configuration file.  See the section on

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The <application>ppp</application> utility (or any other
	    program for that matter) should never dump core.  Because
	    &man.ppp.8; runs setuid (with an effective user&nbsp;ID of

	    core image of &man.ppp.8; to disk before terminating it.
	    If, however &man.ppp.8; is actually terminating due to a
	    segmentation violation or some other signal that normally
	    causes core to be dumped, <emphasis>and</emphasis> you are
	    sure you are using the latest version (see the start of this

&prompt.root; <userinput>echo STRIP= &gt;&gt; /etc/make.conf</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>echo CFLAGS+=-g &gt;&gt; /etc/make.conf</userinput>
&prompt.root; <userinput>make install clean</userinput></screen>

	  <para>You will now have a debuggable version of &man.ppp.8;

	    run &man.ppp.8; as all of its privileges have been revoked.
	    When you start &man.ppp.8;, take a careful note of what your
	    current directory was at the time.</para>

	  <para>Now, if and when &man.ppp.8; receives the segmentation
	    violation, it will dump a core file called

	<question xml:id="ppp-autodialprocess-noconnect">
	  <para>Why does the process that forces a dial in
	    <option>-auto</option> mode never connect?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>This was a known problem with &man.ppp.8; set up to
	    negotiate a dynamic local IP number with the peer in
	    <option>-auto</option> mode.  It has been fixed a long time
	    ago &mdash; search the manual page for
	    <literal>iface</literal>.</para>

	  <para>The problem was that when that initial program calls
	    &man.connect.2;, the IP number of the &man.tun.4; interface
	    is assigned to the socket endpoint.  The kernel creates the
	    first outgoing packet and writes it to the &man.tun.4;
	    device.  &man.ppp.8; then reads the packet and establishes a
	    connection.  If, as a result of &man.ppp.8;'s dynamic IP
	    assignment, the interface address is changed, the original
	    socket endpoint will be invalid.  Any subsequent packets
	    sent to the peer will usually be dropped.  Even if they are
	    not, any responses will not route back to the originating
	    machine as the IP number is no longer owned by that
	    machine.</para>

	  <para>There are several theoretical ways to approach this
	    problem.  It would be nicest if the peer would re-assign the
	    same IP number if possible.  The current version of
	    &man.ppp.8; does this, but most other implementations do
	    not.</para>

	  <para>The easiest method from our side would be to never
	    change the &man.tun.4; interface IP number, but instead to
	    change all outgoing packets so that the source IP number is
	    changed from the interface IP to the negotiated IP on the
	    fly.  This is essentially what the
	    <literal>iface-alias</literal> option in the latest version
	    of &man.ppp.8; is doing (with the help of &man.libalias.3;
	    and &man.ppp.8;'s <option>-nat</option> switch) &mdash; it
	    is maintaining all previous interface addresses and NATing
	    them to the last negotiated address.</para>

	  <para>Another alternative (and probably the most reliable)
	    would be to implement a system call that changes all bound
	    sockets from one IP to another.  &man.ppp.8; would use this
	    call to modify the sockets of all existing programs when a
	    new IP number is negotiated.  The same system call could be
	    used by <acronym>DHCP</acronym> clients when they are forced
	    to call the <function>bind()</function> function for their
	    sockets.</para>

	  <para>Yet another possibility is to allow an interface to be
	    brought up without an IP number.  Outgoing packets would be
	    given an IP number of <systemitem class="ipaddress">255.255.255.255</systemitem> up until the first
	    <literal>SIOCAIFADDR</literal> &man.ioctl.2; is done.  This
	    would result in fully binding the socket.  It would be up to
	    &man.ppp.8; to change the source IP number, but only if it
	    is set to <systemitem class="ipaddress">255.255.255.255</systemitem>,
	    and only the IP number and IP checksum would need to change.
	    This, however is a bit of a hack as the kernel would be
	    sending bad packets to an improperly configured interface,
	    on the assumption that some other mechanism is capable of
	    fixing things retrospectively.</para>

	<question xml:id="ppp-nat-games">
	  <para>Why do most games not work with the
	    <option>-nat</option> switch?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The reason games and the like do not work when
	    &man.libalias.3; is in use is that the machine on the outside
	    will try to open a connection or send (unsolicited) UDP
	    packets to the machine on the inside.  The NAT software does
	    not know that it should send these packets to the interior
	    machine.</para>

	  <para>To make things work, make sure that the only thing
	    running is the software that you are having problems with,
	    then either run &man.tcpdump.1; on the &man.tun.4; interface
	    of the gateway or enable &man.ppp.8; TCP/IP logging
	    (<literal>set log +tcp/ip</literal>) on the gateway.</para>

	  <para>When you start the offending software, you should see
	    packets passing through the gateway machine.  When something
	    comes back from the outside, it will be dropped (that is the
	    problem).  Note the port number of these packets then shut
	    down the offending software.  Do this a few times to see if
	    the port numbers are consistent.  If they are, then the
	    following line in the relevant section of
	    <filename>/etc/ppp/ppp.conf</filename> will make the
	    software functional:</para>

	  <programlisting>nat port <replaceable>proto</replaceable> <replaceable>internalmachine</replaceable>:<replaceable>port</replaceable> <replaceable>port</replaceable></programlisting>

	  <para>where <replaceable>proto</replaceable> is either
	    <literal>tcp</literal> or <literal>udp</literal>,
	    <replaceable>internalmachine</replaceable> is the machine
	    that you want the packets to be sent to and
	    <replaceable>port</replaceable> is the destination port
	    number of the packets.</para>

	  <para>You will not be able to use the software on other
	    machines without changing the above command, and running the
	    software on two internal machines at the same time is out of
	    the question &mdash; after all, the outside world is seeing
	    your entire internal network as being just a single
	    machine.</para>

	  <para>If the port numbers are not consistent, there are three
	    more options:</para>

	  <orderedlist>

		(<filename>alias_ftp.c</filename> is a good prototype).
		This usually involves reading certain recognized

		the outside machine to initiate a connection back to the
		internal machine on a specific (random) port and setting
		up a <quote>route</quote> in the alias table so that the
		subsequent packets know where to go.</para>

	      <para>This is the most difficult solution, but it is the

	<question xml:id="fcs-errors">
	  <para>What are FCS errors?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>FCS stands for Frame Check Sequence.  Each
	    PPP packet has a checksum attached to ensure that the data
	    being received is the data being sent.  If the FCS of an
	    incoming packet is incorrect, the packet is dropped and the
	    HDLC FCS count is increased.  The HDLC error values can be
	    displayed using the <literal>show hdlc</literal>
	    command.</para>

	  <para>If your link is bad (or if your serial driver is
	    dropping packets), you will see the occasional FCS error.
	    This is not usually worth worrying about although it does
	    slow down the compression protocols substantially.  If you
	    have an external modem, make sure your cable is properly
	    shielded from interference &mdash; this may eradicate the
	    problem.</para>

	  <para>If your link freezes as soon as you have connected and
	    you see a large number of FCS errors, this may be because your
	    link is not 8-bit clean.  Make sure your modem is not using
	    software flow control (XON/XOFF).  If your datalink
	    <emphasis>must</emphasis> use software flow control, use the
	    command <literal>set accmap 0x000a0000</literal> to tell
	    &man.ppp.8; to escape the <literal>^Q</literal> and
	    <literal>^S</literal> characters.</para>

	  <para>Another reason for seeing too many FCS errors may be
	    that the remote end has stopped talking
	    <acronym>PPP</acronym>.  You may want to enable
	    <literal>async</literal> logging at this point to determine
	    if the incoming data is actually a login or shell prompt.
	    If you have a shell prompt at the remote end, it is possible
	    to terminate &man.ppp.8; without dropping the line by using
	    <command>close lcp</command> (a following
	    <command>term</command>) will reconnect you to the
	    shell on the remote machine.</para>

	  <para>If nothing in your log file indicates why the link might

	<question xml:id="found-serial">
	  <para>How do I tell if &os; found my serial ports or modem
	    cards?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>As the &os; kernel boots, it will probe for the serial
	    ports in your system for which the kernel was configured.
	    You can either watch your system closely for the messages it
	    prints or run this command after your system is up and
	    running:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>dmesg | grep -E "^sio[0-9]"</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Here is some example output from the above
	    command:</para>

	  <programlisting>sio0: &lt;16550A-compatible COM port&gt; port 0x3f8-0x3ff irq 4 flags 0x10 on acpi0
sio0: type 16550A
sio1: &lt;16550A-compatible COM port&gt; port 0x2f8-0x2ff irq 3 on acpi0
sio1: type 16550A</programlisting>

	  <para>This shows two serial ports.  The first is on
	    IRQ&nbsp;4, is using port address <literal>0x3f8</literal>,
	    and has a 16550A-type UART chip.  The second uses the same
	    kind of chip but is on IRQ&nbsp;3 and is at port address
	    <literal>0x2f8</literal>.  Internal modem cards are treated
	    just like serial ports &mdash; except that they always have
	    a modem <quote>attached</quote> to the port.</para>

	  <para>The <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel includes support
	    for two serial ports using the same IRQ and port address
	    settings in the above example.  If these settings are not
	    right for your system, or if you have added modem cards or
	    have more serial ports than your kernel is configured for,
	    just reconfigure your kernel.  See section <link linkend="make-kernel">about building a kernel</link> for
	    more details.</para>

	<question xml:id="access-serial-ports">
	  <para>How do I access the serial ports on &os;?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The third serial port, <filename>sio2</filename>
	    (see &man.sio.4;, known as <filename>COM3</filename> in
	    DOS), is on <filename>/dev/cuad2</filename> for dial-out
	    devices, and on <filename>/dev/ttyd2</filename> for
	    dial-in devices.  What is the difference between these two
	    classes of devices?</para>

	  <para>You use
	    <filename>ttydX</filename>
	    for dial-ins.  When opening
	    <filename>/dev/ttydX</filename>
	    in blocking mode, a process will wait for the corresponding
	    <filename>cuadX</filename>
	    device to become inactive, and then wait for the carrier
	    detect line to go active.  When you open the
	    <filename>cuadX</filename>
	    device, it makes sure the serial port is not already in use
	    by the
	    <filename>ttydX</filename>
	    device.  If the port is available, it <quote>steals</quote>
	    it from the
	    <filename>ttydX</filename>
	    device.  Also, the
	    <filename>cuadX</filename>
	    device does not care about carrier detect.  With this scheme
	    and an auto-answer modem, you can have remote users log in
	    and you can still dial out with the same modem and the
	    system will take care of all the conflicts.</para>

	<question xml:id="enable-multiport-serial">
	  <para>How do I enable support for a multiport serial
	    card?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Again, the section on kernel configuration provides
	    information about configuring your kernel.  For a multiport
	    serial card, place an &man.sio.4; line for each serial port
	    on the card in the &man.device.hints.5; file.  But place the
	    IRQ specifiers on only one of the entries.  All of the ports
	    on the card should share one IRQ.  For consistency, use the
	    last serial port to specify the IRQ.  Also, specify the
	    following option in the kernel configuration file:</para>

	  <programlisting>options COM_MULTIPORT</programlisting>

	  <para>The following <filename>/boot/device.hints</filename>
	    example is for an AST 4-port serial card on
	    IRQ&nbsp;12:</para>

	  <programlisting>hint.sio.4.at="isa"
hint.sio.4.port="0x2a0"
hint.sio.4.flags="0x701"

hint.sio.7.at="isa"
hint.sio.7.port="0x2b8"
hint.sio.7.flags="0x701"
hint.sio.7.irq="12"</programlisting>

	  <para>The flags indicate that the master port has minor number
	    <literal>7</literal> (<literal>0x700</literal>), and all the

	<question xml:id="more-swap">
	  <para>&os; uses a lot of swap space even when the computer has
	    free memory left.  Why?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>&os; will proactively
	    move entirely idle, unused pages of main memory into swap in
	    order to make more main memory available for active use.
	    This heavy use of swap is balanced by using the extra free
	    memory for cacheing.</para>

	  <para>Note that while &os; is proactive in this regard, it
	    does not arbitrarily decide to swap pages when the system is
	    truly idle.  Thus you will not find your system all paged

	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>The simple answer is that free memory is wasted memory.
	    Any memory that your programs do not actively allocate is
	    used within the &os; kernel as disk cache.  The values shown
	    by &man.top.1; labeled as <literal>Inact</literal>,
	    <literal>Cache</literal>, and <literal>Buf</literal> are all
	    cached data at different aging levels.  This cached data
	    means the system does not have to access a slow disk again
	    for data it has accessed recently, thus increasing overall
	    performance.  In general, a low value shown for
	    <literal>Free</literal> memory in &man.top.1; is good,

	<question xml:id="chmod-symlinks">
	  <para>Why will <command>chmod</command> not change the
	    permissions on symlinks?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Symlinks do not have permissions, and by default,
	    &man.chmod.1; will follow symlinks to change the
	    permissions on the source file, if possible.  So if you have a file,
	    <filename>foo</filename>, and a symlink to that file,
	    <filename>bar</filename>, then this command will always
	    succeed.</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>chmod g-w bar</userinput></screen>

	  <para>However, the permissions on <filename>bar</filename>
	    will not have changed.</para>

	  <para>When changing modes of the file hierarchies rooted in the
	    files instead of the files themselves,
	    you have to use either <option>-H</option> or
	    <option>-L</option> together with <option>-R</option>
	    to make this work.  See &man.chmod.1; and
	    &man.symlink.7; for more information.</para>

	  <warning>
	    <para><option>-R</option> does a
	      <emphasis>recursive</emphasis> &man.chmod.1;.  Be careful
	      about specifying directories or symlinks to directories to
	      &man.chmod.1;.  If you want to change the permissions of a
	      directory referenced by a symlink, use &man.chmod.1;
	      without any options and follow the symlink with a trailing
	      slash (<filename>/</filename>).  For example, if
	      <filename>foo</filename> is a symlink to directory
	      <filename>bar</filename>, and you want to change the
	      permissions of <filename>foo</filename> (actually
	      <filename>bar</filename>), you would do something
	      like:</para>

	    <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>chmod 555 foo/</userinput></screen>

	    <para>With the trailing slash, &man.chmod.1; will follow the
	      symlink, <filename>foo</filename>, to change the

	<answer>
	  <para>The really, really short answer is that you should not.
	    The somewhat longer answer is that just because you are
	    capable of building a bikeshed does not mean you should stop
	    others from building one just because you do not like the
	    color they plan to paint it.  This is a metaphor indicating
	    that you need not argue about every little feature just

	    inversely proportional to the complexity of the

	      of you have asked me.</para>

	    <para>It is a long story, or rather it is an old story, but
	      it is quite short actually.  C. Northcote Parkinson wrote

	    <para>In the specific example involving the bike shed, the
	      other vital component is an atomic power-plant, I guess

	    <para>Parkinson shows how you can go into the board of
	      directors and get approval for building a multi-million or
	      even billion dollar atomic power plant, but if you want to
	      build a bike shed you will be tangled up in endless
	      discussions.</para>

	    <para>Parkinson explains that this is because an atomic
	      plant is so vast, so expensive and so complicated that
	      people cannot grasp it, and rather than try, they fall
	      back on the assumption that somebody else checked all the
	      details before it got this far.  Richard P. Feynmann
	      gives a couple of interesting, and very much to the point,
	      examples relating to Los Alamos in his books.</para>

	    <para>A bike shed on the other hand.  Anyone can build one
	      of those over a weekend, and still have time to watch the
	      game on TV.  So no matter how well prepared, no matter how
	      reasonable you are with your proposal, somebody will seize
	      the chance to show that he is doing his job, that he is

	<answer>
	  <para>Q.  Has anyone done any temperature testing while

	    never seen a mention of &os;.  It seems to run really
	    hot.</para>

	  <para>A.  No, but we have done numerous taste tests on
	    blindfolded volunteers who have also had 250 micrograms of
	    LSD-25 administered beforehand.  35% of the volunteers said
	    that &os; tasted sort of orange, whereas &linux; tasted like
	    purple haze.  Neither group mentioned any significant
	    variances in temperature.  We eventually had to throw the
	    results of this survey out entirely anyway when we found
	    that too many volunteers were wandering out of the room
	    during the tests, thus skewing the results.  We think most

	<question xml:id="letmeoutofhere">
	  <para>Who is scratching in my memory banks??</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Q.  Is there anything <quote>odd</quote> that &os; does
	    when compiling the kernel which would cause the memory to
	    make a scratchy sound?  When compiling (and for a brief
	    moment after recognizing the floppy drive upon startup, as
	    well), a strange scratchy sound emanates from what appears
	    to be the memory banks.</para>

	  <para>A.  Yes!  You will see frequent references to
	    <quote>daemons</quote> in the BSD documentation, and what
	    most people do not know is that this refers to genuine,
	    non-corporeal entities that now possess your computer.  The
	    scratchy sound coming from your memory is actually
	    high-pitched whispering exchanged among the daemons as they
	    best decide how to deal with various system administration
	    tasks.</para>

	  <para>If the noise gets to you, a good
	    <command>fdisk /mbr</command> from DOS will get rid of them,
	    but do not be surprised if they react adversely and try to
	    stop you.  In fact, if at any point during the exercise you
	    hear the satanic voice of Bill Gates coming from the
	    built-in speaker, take off running and do not ever look
	    back!  Freed from the counterbalancing influence of the BSD
	    daemons, the twin demons of DOS and &windows; are often able
	    to re-assert total control over your machine to the eternal
	    damnation of your soul.  Now that you know, given a choice
	    you would probably prefer to get used to the scratchy
	    noises, no?</para>

	<question xml:id="dev-null">
	  <para>Where does data written to
	    <filename>/dev/null</filename> go?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>It goes into a special data sink in the CPU where it is
	    converted to heat which is vented through the heatsink / fan
	    assembly.  This is why CPU cooling is increasingly
	    important; as people get used to faster processors, they
	    become careless with their data and more and more of it ends
	    up in <filename>/dev/null</filename>, overheating their
	    CPUs.  If you delete <filename>/dev/null</filename> (which
	    effectively disables the CPU data sink) your CPU may run
	    cooler but your system will quickly become constipated with
	    all that excess data and start to behave erratically.  If
	    you have a fast network connection you can cool down your
	    CPU by reading data out of <filename>/dev/random</filename>
	    and sending it off somewhere; however you run the risk of
	    overheating your network connection and
	    <filename>/</filename> or angering your ISP, as most of the
	    data will end up getting converted to heat by their
	    equipment, but they generally have good cooling, so if you
	    do not overdo it you should be OK.</para>

	  <para><emphasis>Paul Robinson adds:</emphasis></para>

	  <para>There are other methods.  As every good sysadmin knows,
	    it is part of standard practice to send data to the screen
	    of interesting variety to keep all the pixies that make up
	    your picture happy.  Screen pixies (commonly mis-typed or
	    re-named as <quote>pixels</quote>) are categorized by the
	    type of hat they wear (red, green or blue) and will hide or
	    appear (thereby showing the color of their hat) whenever
	    they receive a little piece of food.  Video cards turn data
	    into pixie-food, and then send them to the pixies &mdash;
	    the more expensive the card, the better the food, so the
	    better behaved the pixies are.  They also need constant
	    stimulation &mdash; this is why screen savers exist.</para>

	  <para>To take your suggestions further, you could just throw
	    the random data to console, thereby letting the pixies
	    consume it.  This causes no heat to be produced at all,
	    keeps the pixies happy and gets rid of your data quite
	    quickly, even if it does make things look a bit messy on
	    your screen.</para>

	  <para>Incidentally, as an ex-admin of a large ISP who
	    experienced many problems attempting to maintain a stable
	    temperature in a server room, I would strongly discourage
	    people sending the data they do not want out to the network.
	    The fairies who do the packet switching and routing get
	    annoyed by it as well.</para>

	<question xml:id="kernel-panic-troubleshooting">
	  <para>How can I make the most of the data I see when my kernel
	    panics?</para>
	</question>

	<answer>
	  <para>Here is typical kernel panic:</para>

	  <programlisting>Fatal trap 12: page fault while in kernel mode
fault virtual address   = 0x40
fault code              = supervisor read, page not present
instruction pointer     = 0x8:0xf014a7e5
stack pointer           = 0x10:0xf4ed6f24
frame pointer           = 0x10:0xf4ed6f28
code segment            = base 0x0, limit 0xfffff, type 0x1b
                        = DPL 0, pres 1, def32 1, gran 1
processor eflags        = interrupt enabled, resume, IOPL = 0
current process         = 80 (mount)
interrupt mask          =
trap number             = 12
panic: page fault</programlisting>

	  <para>When you see a message like this, it is not enough to
	    just reproduce it and send it in.  The instruction pointer
	    value is important;
	    unfortunately, it is also configuration dependent.  In other
	    words, the value varies depending on the exact kernel image
	    that you are using.  If you are using a
	    <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel image from one of the
	    snapshots, then it is possible for somebody else to track
	    down the offending function, but if you are running a custom
	    kernel then only <emphasis>you</emphasis> can tell us where
	    the fault occurred.</para>

	  <para>What you should do is this:</para>

	  <procedure>
	    <step>
	      <para>Write down the instruction pointer value.  Note
		that the <literal>0x8:</literal> part at the beginning
		is not significant in this case: it is the
		<literal>0xf0xxxxxx</literal> part that we
		want.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>When the system reboots, do the following:</para>

	      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>nm -n kernel.that.caused.the.panic | grep f0xxxxxx</userinput></screen>

	      <para>where <literal>f0xxxxxx</literal> is the
		instruction pointer value.  The odds are you will not
		get an exact match since the symbols in the kernel
		symbol table are for the entry points of functions and
		the instruction pointer address will be somewhere
		inside a function, not at the start.  If you do not
		get an exact match, omit the last digit from the
		instruction pointer value and try again, i.e.:</para>

	      <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>nm -n kernel.that.caused.the.panic | grep f0xxxxx</userinput></screen>

	      <para>If that does not yield any results, chop off another
		digit.  Repeat until you get some sort of output.  The
		result will be a possible list of functions which caused
		the panic.  This is a less than exact mechanism for
		tracking down the point of failure, but it is better
		than nothing.</para>
	    </step>
	  </procedure>

	  <para>However, the best way to track down the cause of a panic
	    is by capturing a crash dump, then using &man.kgdb.1; to
	    generate a stack trace on the crash dump.</para>

	  <para>In any case, the method is this:</para>

	  <procedure>
	    <step>
	      <para>Make sure that the following line is included in
		your kernel configuration file
		(<filename>/usr/src/sys/arch/conf/MYKERNEL</filename>):</para>

	      <programlisting>makeoptions     DEBUG=-g          # Build kernel with gdb(1) debug symbols</programlisting>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>Change to the <filename>/usr/src</filename>
		directory:</para>

	      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>cd /usr/src</userinput></screen>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>Compile the kernel:</para>

	      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make buildkernel KERNCONF=MYKERNEL</userinput></screen>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>Wait for &man.make.1; to finish compiling.</para>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <screen>&prompt.root; <userinput>make installkernel KERNCONF=MYKERNEL</userinput></screen>
	    </step>

	    <step>
	      <para>Reboot.</para>
	    </step>
	  </procedure>

	  <note>
	    <para>If you do not use the <varname>KERNCONF</varname>
	      make variable a <filename>GENERIC</filename> kernel will
	      be built and installed.</para>
	  </note>

	  <para>The &man.make.1; process will have built two kernels.
	    <filename>/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/MYKERNEL/kernel</filename>
	    and
	    <filename>/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/MYKERNEL/kernel.debug</filename>.
	    <filename>kernel</filename> was installed as
	    <filename>/boot/kernel/kernel</filename>, while
	    <filename>kernel.debug</filename> can be used as the source
	    of debugging symbols for &man.kgdb.1;.</para>

	  <para>To make sure you capture a crash dump, you need edit
	    <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename> and set
	    <literal>dumpdev</literal> to point to your swap partition
	    (or <literal>AUTO</literal>).  This will cause the
	    &man.rc.8; scripts to use the &man.dumpon.8; command to
	    enable crash dumps.  You can also run &man.dumpon.8;
	    manually.  After a panic, the crash dump can be recovered
	    using &man.savecore.8;; if <literal>dumpdev</literal> is set
	    in <filename>/etc/rc.conf</filename>, the &man.rc.8; scripts
	    will run &man.savecore.8; automatically and put the crash
	    dump in <filename>/var/crash</filename>.</para>

	  <note>
	    <para>&os; crash dumps are usually the same size as the
	      physical RAM size of your machine.  That is, if you have
	      512&nbsp;MB of RAM, you will get a 512&nbsp;MB crash dump.
	      Therefore you must make sure there is enough space in
	      <filename>/var/crash</filename> to hold the dump.
	      Alternatively, you run &man.savecore.8; manually and have
	      it recover the crash dump to another directory where you
	      have more room.  It is possible to limit the size of the
	      crash dump by using <literal>options
		MAXMEM=N</literal> where
	      <replaceable>N</replaceable> is the size of kernel's
	      memory usage in KBs.  For example, if you have 1&nbsp;GB
	      of RAM, you can limit the kernel's memory usage to
	      128&nbsp;MB by this way, so that your crash dump size will
	      be 128&nbsp;MB instead of 1&nbsp;GB.</para>
	  </note>

	  <para>Once you have recovered the crash dump, you can get a
	    stack trace with &man.kgdb.1; as follows:</para>

	  <screen>&prompt.user; <userinput>kgdb /usr/obj/usr/src/sys/MYKERNEL/kernel.debug /var/crash/vmcore.0</userinput>
<prompt>(kgdb)</prompt> <userinput>backtrace</userinput></screen>

	  <para>Note that there may be several screens worth of
	    information; ideally you should use &man.script.1; to
	    capture all of them.  Using the unstripped kernel image with
	    all the debug symbols should show the exact line of kernel
	    source code where the panic occurred.  Usually you have to
	    read the stack trace from the bottom up to trace
	    the exact sequence of events that lead to the crash.  You
	    can also use &man.kgdb.1; to print out the contents of
	    various variables or structures to examine the
	    system state at the time of the crash.</para>

	  <tip>
	    <para>Now, if you are really insane and have a second
	      computer, you can also configure &man.kgdb.1; to do remote
	      debugging such that you can use &man.kgdb.1; on one system
	      to debug the kernel on another system, including setting
	      breakpoints, single-stepping through the kernel code, just
	      like you can do with a normal user-mode program.</para>
	  </tip>

	  <note>
	    <para>If you have <literal>DDB</literal> enabled and the
	      kernel drops into the debugger, you can force a panic (and
	      a crash dump) just by typing <literal>panic</literal> at
	      the <literal>ddb</literal> prompt.  It may stop in the
	      debugger again during the panic phase.  If it does, type
	      <literal>continue</literal> and it will finish the crash
	      dump.</para>

    <para>This innocent little Frequently Asked Questions document has
      been written, rewritten, edited, folded, spindled, mutilated,
      eviscerated, contemplated, discombobulated, cogitated,
      regurgitated, rebuilt, castigated, and reinvigorated over the last
      decade, by a cast of hundreds if not thousands.
      Repeatedly.</para>
