      <b>Subject:</b> Announcing FreeBSD 2.0.5 RELEASE!</p>

    <p>It is my usual pleasure (and, to a small degree, relief!
      :) to announce the release of FreeBSD 2.0.5R - the final
      release in the 2.0.5 series.</p>

    <p>This release provides both what I hope will be an exciting
      glimpse of some of the new technologies and directions we
      have planned for 2.1R and a stable and much
      easier-to-install alternative to 2.0R.</p>

    <p>Highlights of this release are:</p>

    <ul>
	<li>Multi-lingual documentation files.</li>
	<li>Completely menu driven installation.</li>
	<li>More installation media types.</li>
	<li>Support for a much larger range of PC hardware.</li>
	<li>Easy mounting of DOS partitions and CD devices
	  mounted automatically.</li>
	<li>"Canned" installation types for easy installs.</li>
	<li>Easy post-configuration menu</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And many other new features and bug fixes.</p>

    <p>The ports and packages collection has also been bundled
      with 2.0.5R to prevent synchronization errors.  While this
      does result in a larger overall distribution, it at least
      ensures more consistent results when installing ports and
      packages.</p>

    <p>More information on the release may be found in the
      RELNOTES and README files, so I'll simply leave you all to
      see for yourself!</p>

    <p>The usual locations:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/2.0.5-RELEASE">ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/2.0.5-RELEASE</a></li>
      <li><a href="ftp://freefall.cdrom.com/pub/FreeBSD/2.0.5-RELEASE">ftp://freefall.cdrom.com/pub/FreeBSD/2.0.5-RELEASE</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>As well as the usual mirrors, once they pick it up.</p>

    <p>It is also available on CD from Walnut Creek CDROM, the
      project's principle sponsors.  Please see the release notes
      for ordering information.</p>

    <p>Any feedback should be sent to <a
      href="mailto:hackers@FreeBSD.org">hackers@FreeBSD.org</a>.
      I will be leaving the country shortly (about 3 hours :) and
      will try to read my email as often as possible, but for
      quicker replies please send to the mailing list.</p>

    <p>Thank you!</p>

      <b>Subject:</b> 2.0.5-RELEASE update</p>

    <p>Yes, you have guessed it. As a result of the recent
      feedback we have had about the original 2.0.5-RELEASE, we
      have gone poking and found a couple of bugs on the
      original boot.flp image. There is now a
      <tt>/pub/FreeBSD/2.0.5-RELEASE/UPDATES</tt> directory on <a
      href="ftp://ftp.FreeBSD.org/pub/FreeBSD/2.0.5-RELEASE/UPDATES">ftp.cdrom.com</a>
      and <a
      href="ftp://freefall.cdrom.com/pub/FreeBSD/2.0.5-RELEASE/UPDATES">freefall.cdrom.com</a>
      with a version of boot.flp which will fix the following
      problems:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The kernel was too big to boot on 4Mb machines.</li>

      <li>It was possible to specify the filesystem mount points
	in such a way that the program would mount the filesystem
	before the parent filesystem was mounted (e.g. it would
	mount /usr/local and then /usr)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As the CDROM has not gone to replication yet, this updated
      floppy image will be appearing on the CDROM.</p>

    <p>Sorry to all those who had problems with the first boot
      floppy set - I will personally nail Jordan to his chair and
      nail the chair to the floor in front of his computer the
      next time we roll a release!</p>
