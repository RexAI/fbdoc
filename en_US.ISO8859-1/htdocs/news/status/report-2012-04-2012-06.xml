      <p>ARM Fast Models is platform which helps software developers
	debug systems in parallel with SoC design, speeding up and
	improving system development.  This work is bringing up &os; on
	ARM Fast Models system based on ARM Cortex-A15 and peripheral
	components.  It works in single user mode, using a compiled-in
	kernel RAM disk minimal root file system.</p>

      <p>Current &os; support includes:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>L1, L2 cache, Branch Predictor</li>
	<li>Dual-core (SMP) support setup in WB cache mode</li>
	<li>Cortex-A15 integrated Generic Timer</li>
	<li>Drivers for ARM peripheral components:
	  <ul>
	    <li>PL011 UART controller</li>
	    <li>PL390 GIC - Generic Interrupt Controller</li>
	    <li>SP804 Dual Timer</li>
	  </ul>
	</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Next steps:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Quad-core (SMP) support</li>
	<li>Multi-user mode</li>

    <body>
      <p>&os;'s Atmel support has languished for some time.  A number of
	improvements were urgently needed as demand for newer SoCs has
	materialized.  New SoC support is not hard, but it does wind up
	copying a lot of code.  I have started down the path to make it
	easier to do.  I had planned on making it table driven.  But
	then I discovered with dts files that Atmel was producing.</p>

      <p>So, I plan on moving to using Atmel's <tt>.dsti</tt> files, or
	variations on them.  They have .dsti files for all the AT91SAM9
	parts.  This should allow us to support new SoCs and boards
	faster.</p>

      <p>However, there are some challenges with this approach.  Pin
	multiplexing seems undefined in Atmel's dts file.  Only a few of
	the devices are well-defined at the present time.  And the
	encoding seems to be immature.</p>

      <p>So we have a target-rich port that is quite ripe for
	refactoring.</p>

      <p>For this year, we moved the time of the event earlier by six
	months, so it was held on May 5, 2012 and it was co-located with
	the Austrian Linuxweeks (Linuxwochen &Ouml;sterreich) in Vienna.
	We had many sponsors, like the freshly joined &os; Foundation,
	iXsystems, FreeBSDMall, BSD Magazine, allBSD.de Projekt, that
	enabled us to continue our previously launched series of
	multi-project BSD developer summits all around Central
	Europe.</p>

      <p>To kick off, there was a "stammtisch" (local beer meetup)
	organized in the downtown of Vienna, at Kolar on the Friday
	evening before the event &mdash; as usual.  Then it was followed
	by the event on Saturday that brought many interesting topics
	from the world of &os;, OpenBSD and NetBSD: running NetBSD as an
	embedded system for managing VOIP applications, introduction to
	the Capsicum security framework, relayd(8), the load balancer
	and proxy solution for OpenBSD, status update of the
	developments around the &os; ports tree, using DVCSs in clouds,
	firewalling with pfSense, and mfsBSD.  Please consult the links
	in the report for the details.</p>

      <p>The &os; Project is pleased to announce the completion of the
	2012 Core Team election.  The &os; Core Team acts as the
	project's "Board of Directors" and is responsible for approving
	new src committers, resolving disputes between developers,
	appointing sub-committees for specific purposes (security
	officer, release engineering, port managers, webmaster, et
	cetera), and making any other administrative or policy decisions
	as needed.  The Core Team has been elected by &os; developers
	every 2 years since 2000.</p>

      <p>Peter Wemm rejoins the Core Team after a two-year hiatus, with
	new members Thomas Abthorpe, Gavin Atkinson, David Chisnall,
	Attilio Rao and Martin Wilke joining incumbents John Baldwin,
	Konstantin Belousov and Hiroki Sato.</p>

      <p>The complete newly elected core team is:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>Thomas Abthorpe &lt;tabthorpe@FreeBSD.org&gt;</li>
	<li>Gavin Atkinson &lt;gavin@FreeBSD.org&gt;</li>
	<li>John Baldwin &lt;jhb@FreeBSD.org&gt;</li>
	<li>Konstantin Belousov &lt;kib@FreeBSD.org&gt;</li>
	<li>David Chisnall &lt;theraven@FreeBSD.org&gt;</li>
	<li>Attilio Rao &lt;attilio@FreeBSD.org&gt;</li>
	<li>Hiroki Sato &lt;hrs@FreeBSD.org&gt;</li>
	<li>Peter Wemm &lt;peter@FreeBSD.org&gt;</li>
	<li>Martin Wilke &lt;miwi@FreeBSD.org&gt;</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The new Core Team would like to thank outgoing members Wilko
	Bulte, Brooks Davis, Warner Losh, Pav Lucistnik, Colin Percival
	and Robert Watson for their service over the past two (and in
	some cases, many more) years.</p>

      <p>The Core Team would also especially like to thank Dag-Erling
	Sm&oslash;rgrav for running the election.</p>

      <p>During this period, we translated the 8.3-RELEASE announcement
	and published it in a timely manner.  Newsflash and some other
	updates in the English version were also translated as soon as
	possible.</p>

      <p>For &os; Handbook, translation work of the "cutting-edge" and
	"printing" sections have been completed.  Some updates in the
	"linuxemu" and "serialcomms" section were done.  At this moment,
	"bsdinstall", "cutting-edge", "desktop", "install",
	"introduction", "kernelconfig", "mirrors", "multimedia",
	"pgpkeys", "ports", "printing", and "x11" chapters are

      <p>The ports tree slowly approaches 24,000 ports.  The PR count
	still is close to 1200.</p>

      <p>In Q2 we added 7 new committers and took in one commit bit for
	safe keeping.</p>

      <p>The Ports Management team have been running -exp runs on an
	ongoing basis, verifying how base system updates may affect the
	ports tree, as well as providing QA runs for major ports
	updates.  Of note, -exp runs were done for:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>automake update</li>
	<li>cmake update</li>
	<li>xorg update</li>
	<li>png update</li>
	<li>Fix make reinstall</li>
	<li>Implement <tt>USE_QT4</tt> in <tt>bsd.ports.mk</tt></li>
	<li>KDE4 update</li>
	<li>XFCE4 update</li>
	<li>bison update</li>
	<li>perl5.14 as default</li>
	<li>ruby1.9 as default</li>
	<li>ruby1.8 update</li>
	<li>bsdsort regression test</li>
      </ul>

      <p>A lot of focus during this period was put into getting the
	ports tree into a ready state for &os;&nbsp;9.1.</p>

      <p>A significant step forward was the implementation of
	OptionsNG.</p>

      <p>A record number of Port Managers attended BSDCan 2012, with
	five being present to partake in the week of events, culminating
	in a portmgr PR closing session that dealt with 18 PRs in one
	day.  You can see a group photo at <a
	  href="http://www.facebook.com/portmgr"/>.  While you are
	there, please click on the "Like" icon.</p>

      <p>Beat Gaetzi has been doing ongoing tests with the ports tree to
	ensure a smooth transition from CVS to Subversion.  The tree was
	successfully migrated the weekend of June 14, 2012.</p>

      <p>There was good progress in the last half a year and a lot of
	support from different parties to make redports a stable and
	fast service.</p>

      <p>A long known security concern within tinderbox was raised at
	the BSD-Day in Vienna which was addressed by beat.  That
	improves security and isolation of the concurrent running jobs a
	lot and gives me peace of mind.</p>

      <p>We also recently got two beefy machines from the &os;
	Foundation which increases computing power a lot.  So no more
	backlogs and your jobs finish much quicker.</p>

      <p>But as usual now that we have enough power I was able to make
	another promise come true and integrated Ports QAT functionality
	into redports.  Ports QAT was an automated services that did a
	buildtest after each commit to the official &os; ports tree.  If
	a build fails it sends out mails and logfiles to the committer.
	That finds bad commits quickly and allows the committer to fix
	it before the first user notices.  The former service stopped
	about 2 years ago and we had no proper replacement for that task
	at hand.  Now that this is fully integrated into redports it
	also gives us all the nice benefits of a common platform.</p>

	we need to patch the ports framework to handle that and

	possibility to build all our binary packages with a modern gcc

      <p>During the beginning of this period, an update to the xorg

	included a new flag, <tt>WITH_NEW_XORG</tt>, to get a more
	recent xorg distribution for those with modern hardware.  To get
	KMS support for recent Intel graphics chipsets <tt>WITH_KMS</tt>
	must also be set.  This requires a recent &os; 10-CURRENT or

      <task>Decide how to handle the new and old xorg distributions.  In
