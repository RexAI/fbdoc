  <p>&os; status reports are published quarterly and provide the general
    public with a view of what is going on in the Project, and they are
    often augmented by special reports from Developer Summits.  As they
    are one of our most visible forms of communication, they are very
    important.  This page will provide some advice on writing status
    report entries from <a href="mailto:theraven@FreeBSD.org">David
    Chisnall</a>, experienced in technical writing.</p>

  <p><em>Do not worry if you are not a native English speaker.  The team
    handling status reports, <tt>monthly@FreeBSD.org</tt>, will check
    your entries for spelling and grammar, and fix it for you.</em></p>

  <h2>Introduce Your Work</h2>

  <p><em>Do not assume that the person reading the report knows about
    your project.</em></p>

  <p>The status reports have a wide distribution.  They are often one of
    the top news items on the &os; web site and are one of the first
    things that people will read if they want to know a bit about what
    &os; is.  Consider this example:</p>

  <pre>abc(4) support was added, including frobnicator compatibility.</pre>

  <p>Someone reading this, if they are familiar with UNIX man pages,
    will know that <tt>abc(4)</tt> is some kind of device.  But why should
    the reader care?  What kind of device is it?  Compare with this
    version:</p>

  <pre>A new driver, abc(4), was added to the tree, bringing support for
Yoyodyne's range Frobnicator of network interfaces.</pre>

  <p>Now the reader knows that abc is a network interface driver.  Even
    if they do not use any Yoyodyne products, you have communicated that
    &os;'s support for network devices is improving.</p>

  <h2>Show the Importance of Your Work</h2>

  <p><em>Status reports are not just about telling everyone that things
    were done, they also need to explain why they were done.</em></p>

  <p>Carry on with the previous example.  Why is it interesting that we
    now support Yoyodyne Frobnicator cards?  Are they widespread?  Are
    they used in a specific popular device?  Are they used in a
    particular niche where &os; has (or would like to have) a presence?
    Are they the fastest network cards on the planet?  Status reports
    often say things like this:</p>

  <pre>We imported Cyberdyne Systems T800 into the tree.</pre>

  <p>And then they stop.  Maybe the reader is an avid Cyberdyne fan and
    knows what exciting new features the T800 brings.  This is unlikely.
    It is far more likely that they have vaguely heard of whatever you
    have imported (especially into the ports tree: remember that there
    are 20,000 other things there too...).  List some of the new
    features, or bug fixes.  Tell them why it is a good thing that we
    have the new version.</p>

  <h2>Tell Us Something New</h2>

  <p><em>Do not recycle the same status report items.</em></p>

  <p>Bear in mind that status reports are not just reports on the status
    of the project, they are reports on the change of status of the
    project.  If there is an ongoing project, spend a couple of
    sentences introducing it, but then spend the rest of the report
    talking about the new work.  What progress have been made since the
    last report?  What is left to do?  When is it likely to be finished
    (or, if <q>finished</q> does not really apply, when is it likely to
    be ready for wider use, for testing, for deployment in production,
    and so on)?</p>

  <h2>Open Items</h2>

  <p><em>If help is needed, make this explicit!</em></p>

  <p>Is there any help needed with something?  Are there tasks other
    people can do?  There are two ways in which you can use the open
    items part of the status report: to solicit help, or to give a quick
    overview of the amount of work left.  If there is already enough
    people working on the project, or it is in a state where adding more
    people would not speed it up, then the latter is better.  Give some
    big work items that are in progress, and maybe indicate who is
    focussing on each one.</p>

  <p>List tasks, with enough detail that people know if they are likely
    to be able to do them, and invite people to get in contact.</p>
