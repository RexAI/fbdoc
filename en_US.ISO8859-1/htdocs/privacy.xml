	service provided by Google, Inc.   Google Analytics is a tool
	that enables the &os; Project to see how visitors to our Site
	use our Site and how they arrive at our Site.   Google
	Analytics uses "cookies", which are text files placed on your
	computer, to help our Site to analyze visitor activity.   We
	send Google Analytics data that reports on your use of the
	Site.   That data includes Your Usage Data and is not
	anonymised before it is transmitted to Google Analytics.
	This un-anonymised data is stored by Google on servers, once
	it is transmitted to Google.   Google will use this
	information for the purpose of evaluating your use of the

	public access we permit to the bug reports you submit, the
	mailing lists you subscribe to, and posting content to our
	Site forums, the &os; Project does not share un-anonymised
	data with anyone.</p>
