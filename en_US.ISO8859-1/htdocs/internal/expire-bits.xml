  <h2>Rationale</h2>

  <p>Over time, FreeBSD committers may find other demands on their time,
    and decide that they wish to resign their commit bit.  However, under
    some circumstances, a committer may become inactive over a long period
    of time without explicitly resigning their bit.  Over the long term,
    these accounts can represent a security risk, as well as posing
    procedural questions regarding the degree to which contact information
    and access methods for the account are maintainable.  For these
    reasons, the FreeBSD Core Team approved the following commit bit
    expiration policy, last updated on November 26, 2013.</p>

  <h2>Policy</h2>

  <p>Committers that have not made a commit in 18 months may be removed
    from the access file from time to time.  Committers that wish to get
    back their commit bits will have to reapply with the appropriate
    authority.</p>

  <p>If all of a committer's commit bits expire, then the committer's
    <tt>FreeBSD.org</tt> account may also be suspended at the &os; Core
    Team's discretion.  An account is suspended by disabling login
    access and any other services (such as CGI scripts or non-trivial
    mail forwarding configurations) that execute under the committer's
    account.  Simple mail forwarding will continue to work, and an
    individual may e-mail <tt>core@FreeBSD.org</tt> to update mail
    forwarding settings.  The committer's files may or may not be
    preserved at the &os; Core Team's discretion.  A suspended account
    will be reactivated if any of a committer's commit bits are
    restored.</p>
